<h2>HILDEGARDE'S HARVEST.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE MORNING MAIL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hildegarde</span> was walking home from the
village, whither she had gone to get the mail.
She usually rode the three miles on her bicycle,
but she had met a tack on the road the day
before, and must now wait a day or two till
the injured tire could be mended.</p>

<p>Save for missing the sensation of flying,
which she found one of the most delightful
things in the world, she was hardly sorry to
have the walk. One could not see so much
from the wheel, unless one rode slowly; and
Hildegarde could not ride slowly,&mdash;the joy of
flying was too great. It was good to look at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
everything as she went along, to recognise the
knots on the trees, and stop for a friendly word
with any young sapling that looked as if it
needed encouragement. Also, the leaves had
fallen, and what could be pleasanter than to
walk through them, stirring them up, and hearing
the crisp, clean crackle of them under her
feet? Also,&mdash;and this was the most potent
reason, after all,&mdash;she could read her letters as
she walked, and she had good letters to-day.</p>

<p>The first that she opened was addressed in
a round, childish hand to "Mis' Hilda," the
"Grahame" being added in a different hand.
The letter itself was written in pencil, and read
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My Deer</span>,

<p>"I hop you are well. I am well. Aunt Wealthy is well.
Martha is well. Dokta jonSon is well; these are all the
peple that is well. Germya has the roomatiks so bad he
sase he thinks he is gon this time for sure. I don't think
he is gon, he has had them wers before. Aunt Wealthy gave
me a bantim cock and hens, his nam is Goliath of Gath, and
there nams is Buty and Topknot. The children has gon
away from Joyus Gard; they were all well and they went
home to scool. I miss them; I go to scool, but I don't lik it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
but I am gone to have tee with Mista Peny pakr tonite, Aunt
Wealthy sade I mite. He has made a new hous and it is nise.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"So goodbi from</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Benny</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Hildegarde laughed a good deal over this
letter, and then wiped away a tear or two that
certainly had no business in her happy eyes.</p>

<p>"Dear little Benny!" she said. "Dear little
boy! But when is the precious lamb going to
learn to spell? This is really dreadful! I
suppose 'Germya' is Jeremiah, though it looks
more like some new kind of porridge. And
Mr. Pennypacker with a new house! This is
astonishing! I must see what Cousin Wealthy
says about it."</p>

<p>The next letter, bearing the same postmark,
of Bywood, and written in a delicate and tremulous
hand, was from Miss Bond herself. It
told Hildegarde in detail the news that Benny
had outlined; described the happy departure
of the children, who had spent their convalescence
at the pleasant summer home, all rosy-cheeked,
and shouting over the joy they had
had. Then she went on to dilate on the wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
qualities of her adopted son Benny,
who, it appeared, was making progress in every
branch of education.</p>

<p>"I may be prejudiced, my dear," the good
old lady wrote, "but I am bound to say that
Martha agrees with me in thinking him a <i>most
remarkable</i> child."</p>

<p>Miss Bond further told of the event of the
neighbourhood, the building of Mr. Galusha
Pennypacker's new house. The neighbourhood
of so many little children, his friendship with
Benny, "but more than all, his <i>remembrance of
you</i>, my dear Hildegarde," had, it appeared,
wrought a marvellous change in the old hermit.
The kindly neighbours had met him half-way in
his advances, and were full of good-will and
helpfulness; and when, by good fortune, his
miserable old shanty had burned down one
summer night, the whole neighbourhood had
turned out and built him a snug cottage which
would keep him comfortable for the rest of his
days.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Pennypacker came here yesterday to invite Benny to
drink tea with him (I employ the current expression, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dear, though of course the child drinks nothing but milk at
his tender age; I have always considered tea a beverage for
the aged, or those who are not robust), and in the course of
conversation, he begged me <i>most earnestly</i> to convey to you
the assurance that, in his opinion, the comfort which surrounds
his later days is owing entirely to you. His actual
expression, though not refined, was forcible, and Martha
thinks you would like to hear it:</p>

<p>"'I was a-livin' a hog's life, an' I should ha' died a hog's
death if it hadn't been for that gal.'</p>

<p>"I trust your dear mother will not think it coarse to have
repeated these words. There is something in the very mention
of swine that is repugnant to ears polite, but Martha was
of the opinion that you would prefer to have the message
in his own words. And I am bound to say that Galusha
Pennypacker, though undoubtedly <i>an eccentric</i>, is a thoroughly
well-intentioned person."</p></div>

<p>"Dear Cousin Wealthy!" said Hildegarde, as
she folded the delicate sheet and put it back
into its pearl-gray envelope with the silver seal.
"It must have cost her an effort to repeat
Mr. Pennypacker's words. Poor old man! I
am glad he is comfortable. I must send him
a little box at Christmas,&mdash;some little things
to trim up his new house and prettify it.
Oh! and now, Bell, now for your letter! I
have kept it for the last, my dear, as if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
were raisins or chocolate, only it is better than
either."</p>

<span class="caption">BELL&#39;S LETTER</span>
</div>

<p>The fat square envelope that she now opened
contained several sheets of paper, closely covered,
every page filled from top to bottom with
a small, firm handwriting, but no line of crossing.
The Merryweathers were not allowed to
cross their letters, under penalty of being condemned
to write entirely on postal cards. Let
us peep over Hildegarde's shoulder, and see
what Bell has to say.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Dearest Hildegarde</span>:

<p>"It is two full weeks since I have written, and I am
ashamed; but it is simply because they <i>have</i> been full weeks,&mdash;very
full! There is so much to tell you, I hardly know
where to begin. A week ago to-night our play came off,&mdash;'The
Mouse Trap.' It went beautifully,&mdash;not a hitch anywhere,
though we had only had five rehearsals. I was Willis,
as I told you. I wore my ulster without the cape, and really
looked quite masculine, I think. I had a curly, dark-brown
wig (my hair tucked down my neck,&mdash;it didn't show at
all!) and the prettiest little moustache! Marion Wilson was
Amy, and she screamed most delightfully. In fact, they all
screamed in such a natural and heartfelt way, that some of
the ladies in the audience seemed to feel quite uncomfortable,
and I am sure I saw Madame Mirabelle tuck her skirts close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
around her feet, and put her feet up on the bench in front of
her. Well, we all did our best, though Clarice Hammond
was the best; she is a born actress! and the audience was
very cordial, and we were called before the curtain five times;
and altogether it was a great success. I enclose a flower from
a bouquet that was thrown at me. It was a beauty, and it
struck me right on the head. I thought it was for Clarice,
and was going to hand it to her, but somebody in the audience
cried out, 'Why don't you speak for yourself, Willis?'
and everybody laughed, and they said it was really for me, so
I kept it, and was pleased and proud. I have pressed two or
three flowers in my blue-print book, with the pictures of the
play. I am going to send you some as soon as I can print
some more. The girls snatched all the first batch, so that I
have not a single one left.</p>

<p>"Let me see! What comes next? Oh, next you must hear
about my surprise party. I was in my room one evening,
grinding hard at my Greek (do you think your mother would
object to 'grinding?' It is such old, respectable college slang,
mamma allows it once in a while), when I heard whispering
and giggling in the hall outside. I don't mind telling you,
my dear, that my heart sank, for I had a good lot of Pindar
to do, and there is no sense in shirking one's lessons. But I
went to the door with as good a grace as I could, and there
was our dear Gerty, and Clara Lyndon, and three or four
other girls from Miss Russell's school. They said they had
double permission, from Miss Russell at that end, and Mrs.
Tower at this, to come and give me a surprise party; and here
they were, and they were coming in whether I liked it or not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Of course I did like it after the first minute, for they were all
so dear and jolly. They had borrowed chairs as they came
along through the hall, and one had her pocket full of spoons,
and another had a basket,&mdash;oh, but I am getting on too
fast. Well, Gerty and I sat on the bed, and the others on the
chairs, and we chattered away, and I heard all the school news.
Then presently Mabel Norton opened a basket, and took out&mdash;oh,
Hilda! the most beautiful, <i>beautiful</i> rose-bush, simply
covered with blossoms. It was for me, with a card from
Miss Russell and the whole school; and when I asked what
it all meant, why, it seems that this was the anniversary of
the day last year when I pulled a little girl out of the river,
down near the mill-dam. It was the simplest thing in the
world to do, for any one who was strong and knew how to
tread water; but these dear people had remembered the date,
and had done this lovely thing to&mdash;well, Hilda, I didn't
cry that evening, but somehow I want to now, when I come
to tell you about it. You will understand! It is so lovely to
have such dear, kind friends, that I cannot help it. Well,
then out of another basket came a most wonderful cream
tart, with my initials on it in caramel, and a whole lot,
dozens and dozens, of the little sponge-cakes that I am so
fond of. They cannot make them anywhere in the world, I
think, except at Miss Russell's, and dear good Miss Cary, the
housekeeper, remembered that I was fond of them. Oh, and
a huge box of marshmallows; and we all knew what <i>that</i>
meant. Marshmallows are the&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;the unofficial
emblem of Miss Russell's school; and soon two or
three were toasting over the gas on hat-pins, and I was cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the tart, and Gerty was handing round the sponge-cakes,
and we were all as happy as possible. I ran and
asked the girls along the hall to come in, and as many of
them did come as could get in the door, and the rest sat
in a semicircle on the floor in the hall, and we sang everything
we could think of. All of a sudden we heard a knocking
at the window. I ran and looked out, and there was
something hanging and bobbing against the glass. I opened
the window, and drew in a basket, full of all kinds of things,
oranges and bananas and candy, with a card, 'Compliments
of the Third Floor!' So of course I was running up to
thank them, and say how sorry we were that there was not
room for them, when I almost ran plump into Mrs. Tower,
who was coming along the entry, very stately and superb.
She had heard all about it, and she came to say that, if we
liked, we might dance for half an hour in the parlour. You
can imagine&mdash;no, you cannot, for you never were at college!&mdash;the
wild rush down those stairs. We called the third floor
(they are mostly freshmen), and they came careering down like
a herd of ponies; and the first floor came out of their studies
when they heard the music, and we had the wildest, merriest,
most enchanting dance for just half an hour. Then it was
hurry-scurry off, for Miss Russell's girls were on the very edge
of their time allowance, and had to run most of the way
home (it is only a very little way, and one of the maids had
come with them, and waited for them). And we all thanked
Mrs. Tower as prettily as we knew how, and she said pleasant
things, and then some of the girls helped me to take back
the chairs and straighten things up generally. So the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
frolic was over, and most delightful it was; but, my dear, I
had to get up at five o'clock to finish my Greek next morning,
and the ground floor was not much better off with its philosophy.
And now there are no more gaieties, for the examinations
are 'on,' and we must buckle to our work in good
earnest. I don't expect to have much trouble, as I have kept
up pretty well; but there is enough for any one to do, no
matter how well up she is. So this is the last letter you will
have, my dear, before the happy day that brings us all out
to the beloved Pumpkin House. Oh, what a glorious time
we shall have, all together once more! Roger is still out
West, but hopes to get back for the last part of the holidays,
at least; and Phil's and Jerry's vacation begins two days
before Gerty's and mine. Altogether, the prospect is enchanting,
and one of the very best parts of it is the seeing
you again, dear Hilda. Only three weeks more! Gerty
paints a star on her screen for every day that is gone. Funny
little Gerty! Give my love to your mother, please, and believe
me always, dear Hilda,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Hildegarde gave a half-sigh, as she finished
this letter, and walked on in silence, thinking
many things. Bell's life seemed very free and
full and joyous; it suited her exactly, the strong,
sensible, merry girl; and oh, how much she was
learning! This letter said little about studies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but Hildegarde knew from former ones how
much faithful work was going on, and how
firm a foundation of scholarship and thoroughness
her friend was laying.</p>

<p>"Whereas I," she said aloud, "am as ignorant
as a hedge-sparrow."</p>

<p>As she spoke, a sparrow hopped upon a twig
close by her, and cocked his bright eye at her
expressively.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon!" said Hildegarde, humbly.
"No doubt you are right, and I am
a hundred times more ignorant. I could not
even imagine how to build a nest; but neither
can you crack a nut&mdash;ask Mr. Emerson!&mdash;or
play the piano."</p>

<p>The sparrow chirped defiance, flirted his tail
saucily, and was gone.</p>

<p>"And all girls cannot be students!" said Hildegarde,
stopping to address a young maple that
looked strong-minded. "Everybody cannot go
to college; there must be some who are to be
just girls,&mdash;plain girls,&mdash;and stay at home.
As for a girl going to college when there is
only herself to&mdash;to help make a home&mdash;why,&mdash;she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
might as well be Nero, and done
with it."</p>

<p>She nodded at the maple-tree, as if she had
settled it entirely, and walked on more quickly;
the cloud&mdash;it was a slight one, but still a cloud&mdash;vanished
from her brow, leaving it clear and
sunny.</p>

<p>"The place one is in," she said, "is the place
to be happy in. Of course I do miss them all;
of&mdash;course&mdash;I do! but if ever any girl ought
to be thankful on her knees all day long for
blessings and happinesses, Hildegarde Grahame,
why, you know who she is, and that she does
not spell her name Tompkins."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE CHRISTMAS DRAWER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> was coming. Christmas was only
three weeks off. Oh, how the time was flying!
"How shall I ever get ready?" cried Hildegarde,
quickening her pace as she spoke, as if
the holiday season were chasing her along the
road.</p>

<p>"One is always busy, of course; but it does
seem as if I were going to be about five times
as busy as I ever was before. Naturally! there
are so many more people that I want to make
presents for. Last Christmas, there was Mammina,
and Col. Ferrers and Hugh, and the box
to send to Jack,&mdash;dear Jack!&mdash;and Auntie, and
Mrs. Lankton and the children, and,&mdash;well, of
course, Cousin Wealthy and Benny, and all the
dear people at Bywood,&mdash;why, there were a
good many, after all, weren't there? But now
I have all my Merryweathers in addition, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
see. Of course I needn't give anything to the
boys,&mdash;or to any of them, for that matter,&mdash;but
I do want to, so very much; if only there
were a little more time! I will go up this minute,
if Mammina does not want me, and look
over my drawer. I really haven't looked at it&mdash;thoroughly,
that is&mdash;for three days! Hilda
Grahame, what a goose you are!"</p>

<p>By this time she had arrived at Braeside, the
pretty house where she and her mother passed
their happy, quiet life. Running lightly up the
steps, and into the house, the girl peeped into
the sitting-room and parlour, and finding both
empty, went on up the stairs. She paused to
listen at her mother's door; there was no sound
from within, and Hildegarde hoped that her
mother was sleeping off the headache, which
had made the morning heavy for her. Kissing
her hand to the door, she went on to her
own room, which always greeted her as a friend,
no matter how many times a day she entered it.
She looked round at books and pictures with a
little sigh of contentment, and sank down for
a moment in the low rocking-chair. "Just to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
breathe, you know!" she said. "One must
breathe to live." Involuntarily her hand moved
towards the low table close by, on which lay a
tempting pile of books. Just one chapter of
"The Fortunes of Nigel," while she was getting
her breath?</p>

<p>"No," she said, replying to herself with severity,
"nothing of the kind. You can rest just
as well while you are looking over the drawer.
I am surprised,&mdash;or rather, I wish I were surprised
at you, Hilda Grahame. You are a hard
case!"</p>

<p>Exchanging a glance of mutual sympathy
and understanding with Sir Walter Scott, who
looked down on her benignly from the wall,
Hildegarde now drew her chair up beside a tall
chest of drawers, and proceeded to open the
lowest drawer, which was as deep and wide as
the whole of some modern bureaus. It was
half filled with small objects, which she now
took out one by one, looking them over carefully
before laying them back. First came a
small table-cover of heavy buff linen, beautifully
embroidered with nasturtiums in the brilliant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
natural colors. It was really a thing of beauty,
and the girl looked at it first with natural pride,
then went over it carefully, examining the workmanship
of each bud and blossom.</p>

<p>"It will pass muster!" she said, finally. "It
is well done, if I do say it; the Beloved Perfecter
will be satisfied, I think."</p>

<p>This was for her mother, of course; and she
laid it back, rolled smoothly round a pasteboard
tube, and covered with white tissue paper, before
she went on to another article. Next came
a shawl, like an elaborate collection of snowflakes
that had flitted together, yet kept their
exquisite shapes of star and wheel and triangle.
Cousin Wealthy would be pleased with this!
Hildegarde felt the same pleasant assurance of
success. "There ought to be a bit of pearl-coloured
satin ribbon somewhere! Oh, here it
is! A bit of ribbon gives a finish that nothing
else can. There! now that is ready, and that
makes two. Now, Benny, my blessed lamb,
where are you?"</p>

<p>She drew out a truly splendid scrap-book,
bound in heavy cardboard, and marked "Benny's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Book," with many flourishes and curlicues.
Within were pictures of every imaginable kind,
the coloured ones on white, the black and white
on scarlet cardboard. Under every picture was
a legend in Hildegarde's hand, in prose or verse.
For example, under a fine portrait of an imposing
black cat was written:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Is this Benny's pillow-cat?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No! it is not half so fat!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No! it is not half so fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So it mews in sad despair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Feeling that it has not any</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Chance for to belong to Benny."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hildegarde had spent many loving hours over
this book; her verses were not remarkable, but
Benny would like them none the less for that,
she thought, and she laid the book back with
a contented mind. Then there was a noble
apron for Martha, with more pockets than any
one else in the world could use; and a pincushion
for Mrs. Brett, and a carved tobacco-stopper
for Jeremiah. Beside the tobacco-stopper
lay a pipe, also carved neatly, and Hildegarde
took this up with a sigh. "I don't like to part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with it!" she said. "Papa brought it from
Berne, all those years ago, and I am so used to
it; but after all, I am <i>not</i> likely to smoke a
pipe, even if I have succumbed to the bicycle,
and I do want to send some little thing to dear
Mr. Hartley. Dear old soul! how I should like
to see him and Marm Lucy! We really must
make a pilgrimage to Hartley's Glen next summer,
if it is a possible thing. Marm Lucy will
like this little blue jug, I know. We have the
same taste in blue jugs, and she will not care
a bit about its only costing fifteen cents. Ah!
if everything one wanted to buy cost fifteen
cents, one would not be so distracted; but I
<i>do</i> want to get 'Robin Hood' for Hugh, and
where am I to get the three dollars, I ask
you?"</p>

<p>She addressed William the Silent; the hero
drew her attention, in his quiet way, to his
own sober dress and simple ruff, and seemed to
think that Hugh would be just as well off without
the record of a ruffling knave who wore
Lincoln green, and was not particular how he
came by it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! but that is all you know, dear sir!"
said Hildegarde. "We all have our limitations,
and if you had only known Robin, you would
see how right I am."</p>

<p>And then Hildegarde fell a-dreaming, and
imagined a tea-party that she might give, to
which should come William of Orange and
Robin Hood, Alan Breck Stuart and Jim
Hawkins.</p>

<p>"And who else? let me see! Hugh, of
course, and Jack, if he were here, and the
boys and&mdash;and Captain Roger; only I am
afraid he would think it nonsense. But Bell
would love it, and I would invite Dundee, just
to show her how wrong she is about him.
And&mdash;oh, none of the King Arthur knights,
because they had no sense of humour, and Alan
would be at their throats in five minutes; but&mdash;why,
I have left out David Balfour himself,&mdash;Roger
would love David, anyhow,&mdash;and
Robin might bring Little John and Will Scarlet
and Allan-a-Dale. We would have tea out on
the veranda, of course, and Auntie would
make one of her wonderful chicken pies, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I would ask Robin whether it was not just
as good as a venison pasty. Alan would have
his hand at his sword, ready to leap up if it
was denied; but jolly Robin would make me
a courtly bow, and say with his own merry
smile&mdash;Come in! oh! what is it?"</p>

<p>Rudely awakened from her pleasant dream
by a knock at the door, Hildegarde looked
up, half expecting to see one of her heroes
standing cap in hand before her. Instead,
there stood, ducking and sidling,&mdash;the Widow
Lankton.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Lankton?" said
Hildegarde, with an effort. It was a sudden
change, indeed, from Robin Hood and Alan
Breck, to this forlorn little body, with her
dingy black dress and crumpled bonnet; but
Hildegarde tried to "look pleasant," and waited
patiently for the outpouring that she knew she
must expect.</p>

<p>"<i>Good</i>-mornin', dear!" said the widow,
ducking a little further to one side, so that
she looked like an apologetic crab in mourning
for his claws. "I hope your health is good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Miss Grahame. There! you look pretty well,
I must say!"</p>

<p>"I hope you are not sorry, Mrs. Lankton,"
smiling; for the tone was that of heartfelt
sorrow.</p>

<p>"No, dear! why, no, certainly not! I'm
pleased enough to have you look young and
bloomin' while you can. Looks ain't allers
what we'd oughter go by, but we must take
'em and be thankful for so much, as I allers
say. Yes, dear. Your blessed mother's lyin'
down, Mis' Auntie told me. <i>She</i> seems slim
now, don't she? If I was in your place, I
should be dretful anxious about her, alone in
the world as you'd be if she was took. The
Lord's ways is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you want to see me about anything
special, Mrs. Lankton?" said Hildegarde, interrupting.
She felt that she was not called upon
to bear this kind of thing.</p>

<p>The widow sniffed sadly and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear! You're quick and light, ain't
you, as young folks be! Like to brisk up and
have done with a thing. Well, I come to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
if I could borry a crape bunnit, to go to a
funeral; there, Miss Grahame, I hope you
won't think me forth-puttin', but I felt that
anything your blessed ma had worn would
be a privilege, I'm sure, and so regardin' it,
I come."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hildegarde, with a little shudder.
"We&mdash;we have no crape, Mrs. Lankton. My
father&mdash;that is, my mother never wore it."</p>

<p>"Didn't!" said Mrs. Lankton. "Well, now,
folks has their views. I was one that never
liked to spare where feelin's was concerned.
Ah! I've wore crape enough in my time to
bury me under, you might say. When my
poor husband died, I got a veil measured three
yards, countin' the hem; good crape it was,
too. There! I took and showed it to him
the day before he was took. He'd been failin'
up quite a spell, and I was never one to hide
their end from them that was comin' to it.
'There, Peleg!' says I. 'I want you should
know that I sha'n't slight nothin' when you're
gone,' I says. 'I'll keep you as long as I
can,' I says, 'and I'll have everything right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and fittin' as far as my means goes,' I says.
He was real gratified. I was glad to please
him, goin' so soon as he was.</p>

<p>"He turned up his toes less than twenty-four
hours after I said them words; died off real
nice. His moniment is handsome, if I do say
it. I have it scrubbed every spring, come house-cleanin'
time, and it looks as good as new. Yes,
dear! I've got a great deal to be thankful for,
if I have suffered more than most."</p>

<p>Hildegarde set her teeth. Inwardly she was
saying, "You dreadful old ghoul! When will you
stop your grisly recollections, and go away?"
But all she said aloud was, "Well, Mrs. Lankton,
I am sorry that we cannot help you. Perhaps
one of the neighbours,&mdash;but I ought to ask,&mdash;I
trust it is no near relative that is dead?"</p>

<p>"No, dear!" replied the widow, with unction.
"No relation, only by marriage. My sister's
husband married this man's sister for his third
wife; old man Topliffe it is, keeps the grocery
over t' the Corners."</p>

<p>"Why, I did not know he was dead!" said
Hildegarde.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet he ain't, dear!" said Mrs. Lankton.
"But he's doomed to die, and the doctors don't
give him more than a few hours. I'm one that
likes to be beforehand in such matters,&mdash;there's
them that looks to me to do what's right and
proper,&mdash;and I shouldn't want to be found without
a bunnit provided. Well, dear, I must be
goin'. Ah! 'twill seem nat'ral to be goin' to a
funeral again, Miss Grahame. I ain't b'en to one
for as much as five months. I've seen the time
when three funerals a week was no uncommon
thing round these parts, and most all of 'em kin
to me by blood <i>or</i> marriage. Yes, no one knows
what I've b'en through. You're gettin' fleshy,
ain't you, dear? I hope the Lord'll spare you
<i>and</i> your ma,&mdash;she's like a mother to me, I
allers say,&mdash;through <i>my</i> time. It ain't likely
to be long, with these spells that ketches me.
<i>Good</i>-by, dear!"</p>

<p>With a tender smile, and another sidelong
duck, the widow took herself off; and Hildegarde
drew a long breath, and felt like opening
all the windows, to let the sunshine come in more
freely. The door of her room being still open,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she became aware of sounds from below; sounds
as of clashing metal, and rattling crockery.</p>

<p>What could Auntie be about? she would wake
Mamma at this rate.</p>

<p>Running down-stairs, Hildegarde went into the
kitchen, and was confronted by the sight of
Auntie, perched on top of a tall step-ladder,
with the upper part of her portly person buried
in the depths of a cupboard.</p>

<p>"Auntie, what <i>are</i> you about?" she cried.
"Do you know what a noise you are making?
Mamma is asleep, and I don't want her to
wake till tea-time, for her head has ached all
day."</p>

<p>Auntie did not seem to hear at first, but continued
to rattle tins in an alarming way; till
Hildegarde, in despair, grasped the step-ladder,
and shook it with some force. Then the good
woman drew her head out of the depths, and
looked down in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, for goodness sake, honey, is dat you?"
she said. "I t'ought 'twas dat old image cacklin'
at me still. She gone, is she? well, dat's
mercy enough for one day!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>She sat down on the top of the ladder and
panted; and Hildegarde burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Auntie, did you go up there to get rid of
Mrs. Lankton?"</p>

<p>"For shore I did, chile! I'd ha' riz through
de roof if I could, but dis was as fur as I could
git. She was in hyar an hour, 'most, 'fore she
went up-stairs,&mdash;and I told her not go near you,
but she snoke up, and I dassn't holler, fear ob
waking yer ma,&mdash;and my head is loose on my
shoulders now, listenin' to her clack. So when
I hear her comin' down again, I jest put up de
ladder here, and I didn't hear no word she said.
Did she hab de imp'dence to ask you lend her a
crape bunnit?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is what she came for. We had
none, of course."</p>

<p>Auntie snorted. "None ob her business
whedder you had none or a hunderd!" she
said. "I tole her if she ask you dat, I'd pull
her own bunnit off'n her next time she come;
and I will so!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you won't, Auntie!" said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Well, now, you'll see. Miss Hildy chile!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I had 'nuff ob dat woman. Ole barn-cat, comin'
snoopin' round here to see what she can git
out'n you and yer ma, 'cause she sees yer like
two chillen. What yer want for supper, honey,
waffles, or corn-pone?"</p>

<p>"Waffles," said Hildegarde, with decision.
"But&mdash;Auntie, what have you there? No, not
the pitcher; those little tin things that you
just laid down. I want to see them, please."</p>

<p>"I been rummagin' dis shelf," said Auntie.
"I put a lot ob odd concerns up here,&mdash;foun'
em in de place when we come,&mdash;and
dey ain't no good, and I want de room. Dose?
Dem's little moulds, I reckon. Well, now, I
don't seem as if I noticed dem before. Kin'
o' pretty, ain't dey, honey?"</p>

<p>She handed down a set of tin moulds, of
fairy size and quaint, pretty shapes. Tulips,
lilies, crocuses,&mdash;"Why, it is a tin flower-bed!"
cried Hildegarde. "Why did you never show
me these before, Auntie?"</p>

<p>But Auntie was not conscious of having noticed
them before. She had cleaned them,&mdash;of
course,&mdash;but her mind must have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on her cooking, and she did not remember
them.</p>

<p>"And what could one do with them?" Hildegarde
went on. "Oh, see! here is a scrap of
parchment fastened to the ring of one of them.
'The moulds for the almond cakes. The receipt
is in the manuscript book with yellow covers.'
Why, how interesting this is! Almond cakes!
It sounds delightful! Do you remember where
I put that queer old book, Auntie? You thought
the receipts so extravagant that I have not
used it at all. Oh! here it is, in your table-drawer.
I might have been sure that you
would know exactly where it was. Now let us
see. This may be a special providence, Auntie."</p>

<p>"I don't unnerstand what you talkin' 'bout,
chile," said Auntie, good-naturedly. "I made
you almond cake last week, and I guess dat
was good 'nuff, 'thout lookin' in de grandmother
books. But you can see,&mdash;mebbe you find
somethin' different."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was already deep in the old
manuscript book. Its leaves were yellow with
age, the ink faded, but the receipts were perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
legible, many of the later ones being
in Miss Barbara Aytoun's fine, crabbed, yet
plain hand.</p>

<p>"'Bubble and Squeak!' Auntie, I wish you
would give us Bubble and Squeak for dinner
some day. You are to make it of cold beef,
and then at the end of the receipt she tells
you that pork is much better.&mdash;'China Chilo!
Mince a pint basin of undressed neck of
mutton'&mdash;How <i>is</i> one to mince a basin, do you
suppose? I should have to drop it from the
roof of the house, and then it would not be
fine enough.&mdash;'Serve it fried of a beautiful
colour'&mdash;no! that's not it!&mdash;'Pigs' feet. Wash
your feet thoroughly, and boil, or rather stew
them gently'&mdash;Miss Barbara, I am surprised
at you!&mdash;'Ramakins'&mdash;those might be good.
'Excellent Negus'&mdash;ah! here we are! 'Almond
cakes!' H'm! 'Beat a pound of almonds fine'&mdash;and
a pleasant thing it is to do&mdash;'with rose
water&mdash;half a pound of sifted sugar&mdash;beat
with a spoon'&mdash;ah, this is the part I was
looking for, Auntie! 'Bake them in the flower-moulds,
watching carefully; when a beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
light gold colour, take them out, and fill when
cold with cream into which is beat shredded
peaches or apricots.' O&mdash;oh! doesn't that
sound good, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Good 'nuff," Auntie assented, nodding her
turbaned head. "Good deal of bodder to make,
'pears to me, Miss Hildy. I'm gittin' old for
de fancy cakes, 'pears like."</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear soul! I don't want you to
make them," cried Hildegarde. "I want to
make them myself. Now, Auntie, I am going
to be very confidential."</p>

<p>Auntie's dark face glowed with pleasure.
She loved a little confidence.</p>

<p>"You see," Hildegarde went on, "I want
some money. Not that I don't have enough
for everything; but I want to earn a little
myself, so that I can make all the Christmas
presents I want, without feeling that I am
taking it out of the family purse. You understand,
I am sure, Auntie!" and Auntie, who
had held Hildegarde in her arms when she
was a baby, nodded her head, and understood
very well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I thought that possibly I might make
something to send to the Woman's Exchange
in New York. I saw in a magazine the other
day that the ladies who give a great many
lunches are always wishing to find new little
prettinesses for their tables. I saw something of
that myself, when I was there this fall." But
Hildegarde checked herself, feeling that she was
getting rather beyond Auntie's depth.</p>

<p>"And I had been wondering what I could
make, this very afternoon, and thinking of one
thing and another; and when I saw these pretty
little moulds, it seemed the very thing I had
been looking for. What do you think, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"T'ink? I t'ink dem Noo York ladies better
be t'ankful to git anything you make for 'em,
Miss Hildy; dat's my 'pinion! And I'll help
ye make de cake, and fuss round a little wid
de creams, too, if you let me."</p>

<p>But Hildegarde declared she would not let
her have any hand whatever in the making
of the almond cakes, and ran off, hearing her
mother's voice calling her from up-stairs.</p>

<p>"My dear suz!" said the black woman, gazing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
after her. "T'ink ob my little baby missy
growed into dat capable young lady, wat make
anything she touch her finger to. Ain't her
match in Noo York, tell yer; no, nor Virginny,
nudder!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>AUNT EMILY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> you really think I would better stay
several days, Mammina? I don't like to leave
you alone. Some one might come and carry you
off! How should I feel if I came back next week,
and found you gone?" Hildegarde looked down
at her mother, as she sat in her low chair by
the fire; she spoke playfully, but with an undertone
of wistfulness. Mrs. Grahame had grown
rather shadowy in the last year; she looked
small and pale beside Hildegarde's slender but
robust figure; and the girl's eyes dwelt on her
with a certain anxiety. But nothing could be
brighter or more cheerful than Mrs. Grahame's
smile, nor could a voice ring more merrily than
hers did as she responded to Hildegarde's tone,
rather than her words.</p>

<p>"There <i>have</i> been rumours of a griffin lurking
in the neighbourhood. He is said to have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
particular fancy for old&mdash;there, there, Hilda!
don't kill me!&mdash;well, for middle-aged ladies, and
his preference is for the small and bony. I feel
that I am in imminent peril; but still, under all
the circumstances, I prefer to abide my fate;
and I think you would decidedly better spend
two or three days at least with your Aunt
Emily. She has never invited you before, and
her note sounds pretty forlorn, poor old lady!
Besides, if you really want to do something at
the Exchange, you could hardly manage it in
one day. So you shall pack the small trunk,
and take an evening gown, and make a little
combination trip, missionary work and money-making."</p>

<p>"And what will you do?" asked Hildegarde,
still a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"Clean your room!" replied her mother,
promptly.</p>

<p>"Mamma! as if I would let you do that while
I was away!"</p>

<p>"Kindly indicate how you would prevent it
while you were away, my dear! But indeed,
I don't mean a revolutionary, spring cleaning;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I just want to have the curtains washed, and the
paint touched up a little; I saw several places
where it was getting shabby. Indeed, Hilda, I
think the trip to New York is rather a special
providence, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Hildegarde, looking suspiciously
at her parent. "And while I <i>am</i> gone,
it might be a good plan to take up the matting,
and re-cover some of the chairs, and have the
sofa done over, you think?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Mrs. Grahame, falling innocently
into the trap. Whereupon she was
pounced on, shaken gently, embraced severely,
and forbidden positively to attempt anything of
the kind. Finally a compromise was effected,
allowing the washing of the curtains, but leaving
the details of painting, etc., till Hildegarde's
return; and the rest of the evening was spent
in the ever-pleasant and congenial task of making
out a list.</p>

<p>"You cannot be expected to make visits, of
course, dear, in so short a stay; but there are
one or two people you ought to see if possible,"
said Mrs. Grahame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde looked up apprehensively from
her jottings of towels, gloves, and ribbons to
be bought. Her mother's ideas of family duty
were largely developed.</p>

<p>"Aunt Emily will expect you to call on
Cousin Amelia, and no doubt the girls will
come to see you. Your Aunt Anna is in Washington."</p>

<p>"For what we are about to escape&mdash;" murmured
the daughter.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde, I wonder at you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear mamma! what else were you going
to say?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame tried to look severe for a
moment, did not succeed, and put the subject
by.</p>

<p>"Then there is old Madam Burlington; she
would take it as a kindness if you went to see
her; you need not stay more than a quarter of
an hour. A Cranford call is all that is necessary,
but do try to find an hour to go and sit
with poor Cousin Harriet Wither; it cheers her
so to see some young life. Poor Harriet! she
is a sad wreck! You will probably dine at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
your Cousin Robert Grahame's, and if Aunt
Emily wishes you to call on any of the Delansings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you expecting me to stay away over
Christmas?" inquired Hildegarde, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why, darling, surely not! what do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Only that you seem to have started on a
month's programme, my love, that's all. Don't
look so, angel! I will go to see all of them;
I will spend a month with each in turn; only
don't look troubled!"</p>

<p>By and by everything was settled as well as
might be. Mother and daughter went to sleep
with peaceful hearts, and the next day Hildegarde
departed for New York, determined to
make as short a visit as she could in propriety
to Aunt Emily Delansing.</p>

<p>Of her reception by that lady she herself
shall tell:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Blessedest Mother:</span>

<p>"As usual, you were quite right, and I am glad I came.
Hobson was at the station, and brought me up here in a
hansom, and Aunt Emily was in the drawing-room to receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
me. She is very kind, and seems glad to have me here. I
have not done much yet, naturally, as I have not been here
two hours yet. I could not let the six o'clock mail go without
sending you a line, just to say that I am safe and well.
Very well indeed, dearest, and no more homesick than is
natural, and loving you more than you can possibly imagine.
But oh, the streets are so noisy, and there are no birds, and&mdash;no,
I will not! I will be good. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Good-by'">Good-bye</ins> , dearest and
best! Always your very ownest,</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Hilda</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Hilda sealed and addressed her letter, and
then rang the bell. A grave footman in plum-coloured
livery appeared, received the letter as
if it were an official document of terrible import,
and departed. Then, when the door was closed
and she was alone again, Hildegarde leaned
back in her chair and gave herself up to reverie.
Her eyes wandered over the room in which she
was sitting,&mdash;a typical city room, large and lofty,
with everything proper in the way of furnishing.
"Everything proper, and nothing interesting!"
said Hildegarde, aloud. The oak furniture was
like all other oak furniture; the draperies were
irreproachable, but without character; the pictures
were costly, and that was all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Rather wearily Hildegarde rose and began
the somewhat elaborate toilet which was necessary
to please the taste of the aunt with whom
she had come to stay. Mrs. Delansing was her
father's aunt. Since Mr. Grahame's death, his
widow and child had seen little of her. She
considered their conduct, in moving to the
country, reprehensible in the extreme, and signified
to Mrs. Grahame that she could never
regard her as a sane woman again. Mrs. Grahame
had borne this affliction as bravely as she
might, and possibly, in the quietly happy years
that followed the move, she and her daughter
did not give much thought to Aunt Emily or
her wrath. She was well, and did not need
them, and they were able to get on very tolerably
by themselves. Now, however, things had
happened. Mrs. Delansing was much out of
health; her own daughters were settled in distant
homes, and could not leave their own
families to be with her; she felt her friends
dropping away year by year, and loneliness
coming upon her. For the first time in years,
Emily Delansing felt the need of some new face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
some new voice, to keep her from her own
thoughts. Accordingly she had written to Mrs.
Grahame a note which meant to be stately, and
was really piteous, holding out the olive-branch,
and intimating that she should be glad to
have a visit from Hildegarde, unless her mother
thought it necessary to keep the girl buried
for her whole life.</p>

<p>In replying, Mrs. Grahame did not think
it necessary to reply to the last remark, nor
to remind Mrs. Delansing that Hildegarde
had spent a month in New York the winter
before, with an aunt on the Bond side, who
was not in the Delansing set. She said simply
that Hildegarde would be very glad to spend
a few days in Gramercy Park, and that she
might be expected on the day set. And, accordingly,
here Hildegarde was. She had fully
agreed with her mother that it was her duty
to come, if Aunt Emily really needed her;
but she confessed to private doubts as to the
reality of the need. "And you do want me,
Mrs. Grahame, deny it if you dare!" she said.</p>

<p>"Heigh ho!" said Hildegarde again, looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
about her for something to talk to, as was
her way. "Well, so I packed my trunk, and
I came away, and here I am." She addressed
a small china sailor, who was sitting on a
pink barrel that contained matches.</p>

<p>"And if you think I like it so far, my
friend, why, you have less intelligence than
your looks would indicate. What dress would
you put on, if you were I? I think your
pink-striped shirt would be extremely becoming
to me, but I don't want to be grasping. You
advise the brown velveteen? I approve of your
taste!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde nodded to the sailor, feeling that
she had made a friend; and proceeded to array
herself in the brown velveteen gown. It was
a pretty gown, made half-low, with full elbow-sleeves,
and heavy old lace in the neck. When
Hildegarde had clasped the gold beads round
her slender neck, she felt that she was well
dressed, and sat down with a quiet conscience
to read "Montcalm and Wolfe" till dinner-time.
Presently came a soft knock at the
door, and the announcement that dinner was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
served; and Hildegarde laid aside her book
and went down to the drawing-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="600" height="386" alt="&quot;MRS. DELANSING SCRUTINISED HER AS SHE CAME THROUGH THE LONG ROOM.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;MRS. DELANSING SCRUTINISED HER AS SHE CAME THROUGH THE LONG ROOM.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Delansing, seated in her straight, high-backed
armchair, was on the watch for her
grandniece, and scrutinised her as she came
through the long room. Then she nodded, and,
rising, laid her hand on the arm that Hildegarde
offered her.</p>

<p>"Who taught you to enter a room?" she
asked, abruptly. "You have been taught, I
perceive."</p>

<p>"My mother," said Hildegarde, quietly.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mrs. Delansing. "In my
time, one of the most important accomplishments
was to enter a room properly. Nowadays
I see young women skip, and shuffle, and
amble into the drawing-room; I do not often
see one enter it properly. You will, perhaps,
tell your mother that I have mentioned this;
she may be gratified."</p>

<p>Hildegarde bowed in silence, and as they came
into the dining-room, took the place to which
her aunt motioned her, at the foot of the table.
It was a long table, and Hildegarde could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
see the bows of Mrs. Delansing's cap over the
stately epergne that rose between them; but
she was conscious of the old lady's sharp black
eyes watching her through the ferns and roses.
This awoke a rebellious spirit in our young
friend, and she found herself wondering what
would be the effect of her putting her knife
in her mouth, or drinking out of the finger-bowl.
The dinner seemed interminable. It is
not easy to talk to some one whom you cannot
see; but Hildegarde replied as well as she could
to the occasional searching questions that were
darted at her like spear-points through the
ferns, preserved her composure, and was not
too unhappy to enjoy the good food set before
her.</p>

<p>It was a relief to go back to the drawing-room,
which seemed a shade less formal than
the one they left; also, she found a comfortable
chair, and received permission to take out
her embroidery.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that lace?" asked Mrs.
Delansing, suddenly, after a silence during which
Hildegarde had thought her asleep, till, on looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
up, she met the steady gaze of the black
eyes, still fixed on her.</p>

<p>"It is extremely valuable lace; are you aware
of it?" The tone was reproachful, but Hildegarde
preserved a quiet mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is valuable!" she said. "Old
Mr. Aytoun left all his personal property to
Mamma, you know, Aunt Emily; there was a
great deal of lace, some of it very fine indeed;
this is a small piece that went with some broad
flounces. Beautiful flounces they are!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing's eyes lightened, and her
fingers moved nervously. Lace was one of her
few passions, and she could not see it, or even
hear of it, unmoved.</p>

<p>"And what does your mother propose to
do with all this lace?" she asked. "She cannot
wear it herself, in the wilderness that she
chooses to live in."</p>

<p>"Oh, she keeps it!" said Hildegarde. "It is
delightful to have good lace, don't you think so?
even if you don't wear it. And when either of
us wants a bit to put on a gown,&mdash;like this, for
example,&mdash;why, there it is, all ready."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems wanton; it seems almost criminal,"
said Mrs. Delansing, with energy, "to keep valuable
lace shut up in a mouldering country-house.
I&mdash;it distresses me to think of it. I shall feel
it a point of duty to write to your mother."</p>

<p>Hildegarde wondered what her aunt would
feel it her duty to say. It was hardly her
mother's fault that the lace had been left to
her; it seemed even doubtful whether she should
be expected to mould her life upon the lines of
lace; but this seemed an unsafe point to suggest.</p>

<p>"That is very beautiful lace on your dress,
Aunt Emily!" said this wily young woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing's brow smoothed, and she
looked down with a shade of complacency.
"Yes, this is good," she said. "This is very
good. Your grandfather,&mdash;I should say your
great-uncle, bought this lace for me in Brussels.
It is peculiarly fine, you may perceive. The
young woman who made it lost her eyesight in
consequence."</p>

<p>"Oh, how dreadful!" cried Hildegarde.
"How could you&mdash;" "How could you bear
to wear it?" was what she was going to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
but she checked herself, and the old lady went
on, placidly.</p>

<p>"Your great-uncle paid something more than
the price asked on that account. He thought
something more was due; he was a man of
great benevolence. This is point lace."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hildegarde, "Point d'Alen&ccedil;on;
I never saw a more delicate piece."</p>

<p>"Ah! you know point lace!" said Mrs. Delansing.
Her voice took on a new tone, and
she looked at the girl with more friendly eyes.
"I did not know that any young women of the
new generation understood point. These matters
seem to be thought of little consequence
nowadays. I have myself spent months in the
study of a special point, and felt myself well
repaid."</p>

<p>She put some searching questions, relative to
the qualities of Spanish, Venice, and Rose point,
and nodded her head at each modest but intelligent
answer. Hildegarde blessed her mother
and Cousin Wealthy, who had expounded to her
the mysteries of lace. At the end of the catechism,
the old lady sighed and shook her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is an exceptional thing," she said, "to
find any knowledge of laces in the younger generations.
I instructed my own daughters most
carefully in this branch of a gentlewoman's
education, but they have not thought proper to
extend the instruction to their own children. I&mdash;a
shocking thing happened to me last year!"
She paused, and Hildegarde looked up in sympathy.</p>

<p>"What was it, Aunt Emily?" she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing was still silent, lost in distressful
reverie. At length, "It is painful to
dwell upon," she said, "and yet these things
are a warning, and it is, perhaps, a duty to
communicate them. You have met my granddaughters,
your cousins, Violette and Blanche?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Hildegarde, smiling a little,
and colouring a little too. These cousins were
rather apt to attempt the city-cousin r&ocirc;le, and
to treat her as a country cousin and poor relation.
She did not think they had had the best
of it at their last meeting. "Yes, I know
them," she said, simply.</p>

<p>"They are girls of lively disposition," Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Delansing continued. "Their mother&mdash;your
Cousin Amelia&mdash;has been something of an
invalid,&mdash;I make allowance for all this, and
yet there are things&mdash;" She broke off; then,
after a moment, went on again. "Violette
made me a visit last winter, here, in this house.
She was engaged in what she called fancy work,
for a bazaar (most objectionable things to my
mind), that was to be held in the neighbourhood.
One day she came to Hobson&mdash;I was
unwell at the time&mdash;and said,&mdash;Hobson remembers
her very words:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Hobson, see what a lovely thing I have
made out of a bit of old rubbishy lace that was
in this bureau drawer.'</p>

<p>"Hobson looked, and turned pale to her soul,
as she expressed it in her homely way. She
recognised the pattern of the lace.</p>

<p>"'I cut out the flowers,' said the unhappy
girl, 'and applied them'&mdash;she <i>said</i> 'appliqu&eacute;d'
them, a term which I cannot reproduce&mdash;'applied
them to this crimson satin ribbon; it
will make a lovely picture-frame; so unique!'</p>

<p>"She had&mdash;she had taken a piece of my old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Mechlin, which Hobson had just done up and
had laid in the drawer till I should feel strong
enough to examine and approve its appearance,&mdash;she
had taken this and cut it to pieces, cut out
the flowers, to sew them&mdash; There are things
that have to be lived through, my dear. It was
weeks before Hobson felt able to tell me what
had occurred. I was in danger of a relapse for
several weeks, though she did it as delicately
as possible,&mdash;good Hobson. I did not trust myself
to speak to Violette in person; I sent for
her mother, and told her of the occurrence. She&mdash;she&mdash;laughed!"</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes. Hildegarde
wanted to show the sympathy that she
truly felt, for she liked lace, and the idea of
its stupid destruction filled her with indignation.
She ventured to lay her hand timidly on the
old lady's arm, but Mrs. Delansing took no
notice of the caress; she sat bolt upright,
gazing out of the window with stony eyes.
Presently she said:</p>

<p>"You may ring for Hobson, if you please.
I feel somewhat shaken, and will have my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
malted milk in my own room. Another evening,
I may ask your patience in a game of
backgammon,&mdash;you have been taught to play
backgammon? Yes; but not to-night. You
will find books in the library, and the piano
does not disturb me. Good-night, my niece."</p>

<p>She shook hands with Hildegarde, and departed
on Hobson's arm, looking old and feeble,
though holding herself studiously erect. Hildegarde
went to her room, feeling half sad, half
amused, and wholly homesick. She greeted
the china sailor with effusion, as if he were
a friend of years. "Oh, you dear fellow!"
she said. "You are young, aren't you? and
happy, aren't you? Well, mind you stay so,
do you hear?" She nodded vehemently at
him, and took up her book, to read till bedtime.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>GREETINGS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no family breakfast at the house
in Gramercy Park. A smiling chambermaid
brought up a tray to Hildegarde's room, with
all manner of pleasant things under suggestive
little covers. Hilda ate and was thankful,
and then, finding that her aunt would not
be visible before noon, she put on her hat
and went for a walk. The streets were chilly,
in the November morning, but the air was
fresh and good, and Hildegarde breathed it
in joyously.</p>

<p>This was just a walk, she said to herself.
She had many visits to make, of course, and
more or less shopping to do, but there was
time enough for all that. Now she would
walk, and get her bearings, and consider that
one might live well in a city. The brick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sidewalks seemed at once strange and familiar;
she had known the brown-stone streets all
her life. Once they had seemed her own, the
only place worth walking in; now they were
a poor apology, indeed, for shady lanes and
broad sunny roads along which the feet trod
or the wheel spun, winged by "the joy of
mere living." She passed the house where
her childhood had been spent, and paused to
look up at the tall windows, in loving thought
of the dear father who had made that early
home so bright and full of cheer. Dear Father!
There was his smoking-room window, where
he used to sit and read aloud to her, so many
happy hours. How he would dislike those heavy
brocade curtains; he used to thunder, almost
as loud as Colonel Ferrers, about curtains that
kept out the blessed sunshine. How&mdash;the
house was a corner one, and at this moment,
as Hildegarde stood gazing up at the windows,
a gentleman turned the corner, and ran plump
into her.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," said the gentleman, with
great violence, "it is a most extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
thing that a human being should turn himself
into a post for the express purpose of&mdash;I beg
your pardon, madam. I was not conscious
that I was addressing a lady! Can I serve
you in any way? Command me, I beg of you!"</p>

<p>The moment Hildegarde caught the sound
of the gentleman's voice, she turned her head
away, so that he could not see her face; and
now she spoke over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"A place in thy memory, dearest&mdash;sir, is
all that I ask at thy hands. It is hard to be
forgotten so soon, so utterly!"</p>

<p>"What! what! what! what!" said the
Colonel. "Who! who! why&mdash;why the mischief
will you not turn your head round, young
woman? There is only one young woman in
the world who would address me in this manner,
and she is a hundred miles away. Now,
in the name of all that is elfish, Hildegarde
Grahame, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde turned round, her eyes full of
happy laughter, and took her friend's arm.</p>

<p>"And in the name of all that is occult, and
necromantic, and Rosicrucian, Colonel Ferrers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
what are <i>you</i> doing here?" she asked. "I
thought you were in Washington."</p>

<p>"I was, till last night!" the Colonel replied.
"We have seen all the sights, the boy and I,
and now we have come to see the sights here
on our way home. Well! well! and the first
sight I see is the best one for sair een that I
know. What a pity I left the boy at the hotel!
He was still asleep. We arrived late last night.
I went to wake him, and I give you my word,
I could as soon have thought of waking an
angel from a dream of paradise; the little fellow
smiled, you understand, Hildegarde, and&mdash;and
moved his little arms, and&mdash;I came
away, sir,&mdash;my dear, I should say,&mdash;and left
him to sleep as long as he would. Where are
you going now, my child? have you had breakfast?
if not,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have had breakfast, dear sir!" said
Hildegarde. "And you were thinking, if I had
had it, how pleasant for me to go in and surprise
that blessed lamb in his crib; now, weren't
you?"</p>

<p>"The point, as usual!" cried the Colonel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"Country neighbours learn to know each others'
thoughts, they say, but I never believed it, till
I had neighbours. Well, shall we go? Now,
upon my soul, this is the most surprising and
delightful thing that has happened to me for
forty years. But you have not told me where
you are staying, Hilda, nor why you are here,
nor in fact anything; have simply wormed
information out of the confiding friend, and remained
silent yourself!" and the Colonel looked
injured, and twirled his moustaches with mock
ferocity.</p>

<p>"I like that!" said Hildegarde. "That really
pleases me! Kindly indicate, dear sir, the moment
at which I could have got in a word edgewise,
since you began your highly interesting
remarks! I have been simply panting with
eagerness to tell you that I left home yesterday,
and arrived in New York at five o'clock
in the afternoon; that I am staying with my
great-aunt in Gramercy Park; that I am wofully
homesick, and that the sound of your
voice was the most ecstatic sound I have heard
for half a century."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Colonel. "Humph! mockery,
I perceive! of the aged, too! Very well,
Miss Grahame, your punishment will be decided
hereafter. Meanwhile, here we are at my hotel,
and we will go straight up and wake the boy,&mdash;if
he seems to be ready to wake, my dear. I am
sure you will agree with me that it would be a
pity to rouse him from a sound sleep. 'Sleep,
that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,' you
remember, Hildegarde!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Colonel Ferrers!" said Hildegarde.
"But I don't believe Hugh's sleeve is very deeply
ravelled, do you? and indeed, it is high time for
him to be awake."</p>

<p>They turned in at a great white marble portal,
and the elevator soon brought them to the
Colonel's door. He opened it softly with a
latch-key, and led the way into the apartment;
then paused, and beckoned Hilda to
come in quietly.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he whispered. "Hugh is awake!"</p>

<p>They listened, and heard a clear, sweet voice
discoursing calmly:</p>

<p>"I have three pillows to my head, though I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
am not ill. I wish that other boy was here,
that was in bed, and made songs about himself,
and said it was the Land of Counterpane. He
was the Giant great and still, that sits upon the
pillow-hill, and I am that kind of giant too.
Now I play he is here, and he sits up against
that pillow, and I sit up against this. And I
say, 'How can you say all the things that come
in your mind? I can have the things in my
mind, too, but they will not have rhyme-tails to
them. How do you make the rhyme-tails?'</p>

<p>"And then he says,&mdash;I call him Louis, for that
is the prettiest part of his name,&mdash;Louis says,
'It has to be a part of you. I think of things
in short lines, and after every line I look for
the rhyme-tail, and I see it hanging somewhere.
But perhaps your Colonel can help you about
that,' Louis says.</p>

<p>"But I say, 'No! my Colonel cannot help me
about that. My Colonel is good, and I love him
with love that grows like a tree, but he cannot
make rhymes. Now, if my Beloved were here,
she might be able to help me; but she is far
away, and the high walls shut her out from me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The walls are very high here, Louis, and my
Colonel has gone away now, and I don't know
how soon he will come back; so don't you leave
me, Louis, for I am alone in a sandy waste,
and there are no quails. But manna would
be nasty, I think.'"</p>

<p>At this point the listeners could bear no more.
Hilda ran into the room, and had Hugh in her
arms, and was laughing and crying and cooing
over him all at once. The Colonel followed,
very red in the face, blowing his nose and
clearing his throat portentously.</p>

<p>"Why, darling," Hilda was saying between
the kisses, "darling Boy, did you want me?
and did you think your Colonel would leave you
for more than a few little minutes? Of course
he would not! And where do you suppose I
came from, Boy, when I heard you say you
wanted me? Do you think I came down the
chimney?"</p>

<p>Hugh gravely inspected her spotless attire; the
blue serge showed no wrinkle, no speck of dust.</p>

<p>"I should say <i>not</i> the chimney!" he announced,
"But from some strange where you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
must have come, Beloved, if it was a place
where you heard me talking when I was not
there. Was it the up-stairs of the Land of
Counterpane?" he added, his eyes lighting up
with their whimsical look. "Was it the Counterpane
Garret? Then it must have been over
the top of the bed that you came from, and you
seemed to come in at the door. Did Louis tell
you to come?"</p>

<p>"Louis?" said the Colonel. "What does the
boy mean? Stuff and nonsense! I met your
Beloved in the street, ran into her, and thought
she was a post; and then I brought her along,
and here she is; and what do you think about
breakfast, Young Sir?"</p>

<p>Young Sir thought very well of breakfast,
but he could not think of eating it without his
two friends looking on; so Hildegarde waited
in the parlour, chatting merrily with the Colonel
till Young Sir's toilet was completed, and
then breakfast was brought, and Hugh ate,
and the others watched him; and Hildegarde
found that she was quite hungry enough to eat
Black Hamburg grapes, even if it was only two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hours since breakfast, and altogether they were
very merry.</p>

<p>"And what shall we do now?" asked the
Colonel, when the pleasant meal was over.
"The Metropolitan, eh? The boy must see
pictures, Hilda, hey? 'The eye that ne'er on
beauty dwells,' h'm! ha! folderol! I forget the
rest, but the principle remains the same. Never
seen any pictures except those at home, and the
few in Washington. Chiefly rubbish there, I
observe. What do you say, Miss Braeside?
Will you give Roseholme the honour of your
company as far as the Metropolitan?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" thought Hildegarde. "Hobson
said positively that Aunt Emily would not see
me before lunch, and there is no one else that
I need go to see quite so very immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go with pleasure!" she said.
So off they started, the cheerfullest three in
New York that morning. Busy men, hurrying
down-town to their business, turned to look
back at them, and felt the load of care lightened
a little just by the knowledge that there
were three people who had no care, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
going to enjoy themselves somewhere. Hugh
walked in the middle, holding a hand of each
friend, chattering away, and looking up from
one to the other with clear, joyful looks that
made the whole street brighter. The Colonel
was in high feather; flourishing his stick, he
strode along, pointing out the various objects
of interest on the way. He paused before a
mercer's window, filled with shimmering silks
and satins.</p>

<p>"Now here," he said, "is frippery of a superior
description; frippery enough to delight the
hearts of a dozen women."</p>

<p>"Possibly of two dozen, dear sir," put in Hildegarde;
"consider the number of yards in all
those shining folds."</p>

<p>"Hum! ha! precisely!" said the Colonel.
"Now, Hildegarde, you have some taste in
dress, I believe; you appear to me to be a well-dressed
young woman. Now, I say, what seems
to you the handsomest gown in all this folderol,
hey? the handsomest, mind you?"</p>

<p>"'Said the Kangaroo to the Duck, this requires
a little reflection!'" Hildegarde quoted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps, on the whole, that splendid purple
velvet; don't you think so, Colonel Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the Colonel. "Ha! possibly;
but&mdash;ha! hum! that&mdash;I may be wrong, Hildegarde&mdash;but
that seems to me hardly suited
to a young person, hey? More a gown for a
dowager, it strikes me? I may be wrong, of
course."</p>

<p>"Not in the least wrong, dear sir," said
Hilda, laughing. "But you said nothing about
a young person. You said 'the handsomest.'"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the Colonel again. "And
after all, a gown is a temporary thing, Hugh.
Now, a bit of jewelry&mdash;but now, Hildegarde,
I put it to you, if you were going to choose
a gown for Elizabeth Beadle, for example;
suppose Hugh and I were going to take a
present home to Elizabeth Beadle; there's no
better woman of her station in the mortal
universe, sir, I don't care who the second may
be. What do you think suitable, hey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Guardian!" and "Oh, Colonel Ferrers!"
cried Hugh and Hildegarde, in a breath. "How
delightful!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think Hugh ought to choose," said Hildegarde,
with some self-denial; and she added to
herself:</p>

<p>"If only he will not choose the blue and red
plaid; though there is nothing she would like so
well, to be sure!"</p>

<p>Hugh surveyed the shining prospect with
radiant eyes.</p>

<p>"I think you are the very kindest person
in all the world!" he said. "I think&mdash;my
mind is full of thoughts, but now I will make
my choice."</p>

<p>He was silent, and the three stood absorbed,
heedless of the constantly increasing crowd that
surged and elbowed past them.</p>

<p>"My great-aunt is fond of bright colours,"
said the child, at last. Hildegarde shivered.</p>

<p>"She would like best the red and blue
plaid. <i>But</i>, people must not always have the
things they like best. You remember the
green apples, Guardian, and how they weren't
half as good as the medicine was horrid."</p>

<p>"Most astonishing boy in the habitable universe!"
murmured the Colonel, under his breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"Don't undertake to say what kind of boys
there may be in Mars, you understand, but so
far as this planet goes,&mdash;hey? Ha! well, have
you made your choice, Young Sir?"</p>

<p>Hugh pointed out a gray silk, with a pretty
purple figure. "That is the very best thing
for my great-aunt," he said.</p>

<p>"That will fill her with delirious rapture,
and it will not put out the eyes of anybody.
We shall all be happy with that silk."</p>

<p>So in they went to the shop, and Hugh
bought the silk, and the Colonel paid for it,
and then they all went off to the Metropolitan,
and spent the rest of the morning in great joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>AT THE EXCHANGE.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> how have you spent the morning,
my dear?" asked Mrs. Delansing.</p>

<p>They were sitting at the luncheon-table.
Hildegarde could just see the tip of her aunt's
cap above the old-fashioned epergne which
occupied the centre of the table; but her tone
sounded cheerful, and Hildegarde hastened to
tell of her delightful morning. She had enjoyed
herself so heartily that she made the
recital with joyful eagerness, forgetting for the
moment that she was not speaking to her
mother, who always enjoyed her good times
rather more than she did herself; but a sudden
exclamation from Mrs. Delansing brought her
to a sudden realisation of her position.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the old lady, and at
her tone the very ferns seemed to stiffen.
"What are you telling me, Hildegarde? You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
have been spending the morning with&mdash;with
a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gentlemen'">gentleman</ins> , and that gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel Ferrers!" said Hildegarde, hastily,
fearing that she had not been understood.
"Surely you know Colonel Ferrers, Aunt Emily."</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> know Thomas Ferrers!" replied Mrs.
Delansing, with awful severity; "but I do <i>not</i>
know why&mdash;I must add that I am at a loss
to imagine <i>how</i>&mdash;my niece should have been
careering about the streets of New York with
Thomas Ferrers or any other young man."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was speechless for a moment;
indeed, Mrs. Delansing only paused to draw
breath, and then went on.</p>

<p>"That your mother holds many dangerous
and levelling opinions I am aware; but that
she could in any degree countenance anything
so&mdash;so monstrous as this, I refuse to believe.
I shall consider it my duty to write to her immediately,
and inform her of what you have
done."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was holding fast to the arms of
her chair, and saying over and over to herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"Never speak suddenly or sharply to an old
person!" It was one of her mother's maxims,
and she had never needed it before; but now it
served to keep her still, though the indignant
outcry had nearly forced itself from her lips.
She remained silent until she was sure of her
voice; then said quietly, "Aunt Emily, there is
some mistake! Colonel Ferrers is over sixty
years old; he was a dear friend of my father's,
and&mdash;and I have already written to my mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing was silent; Hildegarde saw
through the screen of leaves a movement, as if
she put her hand to her brow. "Sixty years
old!" she repeated. "Wild Tom Ferrers,&mdash;sixty
years old! What does it mean? Then&mdash;then
how old am I?"</p>

<p>There was a painful silence. Hildegarde
longed for her mother; longed for the right
word to say; the wrong word would be worse
than none, yet this stillness was not to be endured.
Her voice sounded strange to herself
as she said, crumbling her bread nervously:</p>

<p>"He is looking very well indeed. He has
been in Washington with little Hugh, his ward;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he had been suffering a great deal with rheumatism,
but the warm weather there drove it
quite away, he says."</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Colonel Ferrers is the kindest neighbour that
any one could possibly have!" the girl went on.
"I don't know what we should have done without
him, mamma and I; he has really been one
of the great features in our life there. You
know he is a connection of dear papa's,&mdash;on
the Lancaster side,&mdash;as well as a lifelong
friend."</p>

<p>"I was not aware of it!" said Mrs. Delansing.
She had recovered her composure, and her tone,
though cold, was no longer like iced thunderbolts.</p>

<p>"I withdraw my criticism of your conduct,&mdash;in
a measure. But I cannot refrain from saying
that I think your time would have been better
employed in your room, than in gadding about
the street. I was distinctly surprised when Hobson
told me that you had gone out. Hobson was
surprised herself. She has always lived in the
most careful families."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde "saw scarlet." "Aunt Emily,"
she said, "blame me if you will; but I cannot
suffer any reflection on my mother. I do
not consider that it would be possible for any
one to be more careful of every sensible propriety
than my mother is; though she does not
mould her conduct on the opinions of servants!"
she added. She should not have said this, and
was aware of it instantly; but the provocation
had been great.</p>

<p>"You admit that your mother is human?"
said the old lady, grimly. "She has faults, I
presume, in common with the rest of humankind?"</p>

<p>"She may have!" said Hildegarde. "I have
never observed them."</p>

<p>Silence again. Hildegarde tried to eat her
chicken, but every morsel seemed to choke her;
her heart beat painfully, and she saw through a
mist of angry tears. Oh, why had she come
here? What would she not give to be at home
again!</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Delansing spoke again, and her
tone was perceptibly gentler.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, you must not think that I mean
to be unkind, nor did I mean&mdash;consciously&mdash;to
reflect upon your mother, for whom your affection
is commendable, though perhaps strongly
expressed."</p>

<p>"I am sorry!" said Hildegarde, impulsively.
"I ought not to have spoken so. I beg your
pardon, Aunt Emily!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing bowed. "You are freely pardoned!
I was about to say, when this little
interruption occurred, that I had hoped you
could be content for a few days under my roof,
without seeking pleasure elsewhere; but age is
poor company for youth."</p>

<p>"But you could not see me this morning,
Aunt Emily! You said last night that you
never saw anybody before lunch. And what
should I do in my room? It is a charming
room, but you surely did not expect me to stay
in it all the morning, doing nothing?"</p>

<p>"I should have thought you might find plenty
of occupation!" said Mrs. Delansing. "In my
time it was thought not too much for a young
lady to devote the greater part of the day to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
care of her person; this, of course, included fine
needlework and other feminine occupations."</p>

<p>"I did not bring any work with me," said
Hildegarde. "You see, I must go back to-morrow,
Aunt Emily, and there are so many
errands that I have to do. This afternoon I
must go out again; and is there anything I can
do for you? I shall be going by Arnold's, if
you want anything there."</p>

<p>"I thank you; Hobson makes my purchases
for me!" said Mrs. Delansing, stiffly. "She
would better accompany you to Arnold's; there
is apt to be a crowd in these large shops, which
I consider unsuited for gentlewomen. I will
tell Hobson to accompany you."</p>

<p>But Hildegarde protested against this, saying,
with truth, that she must pay a visit first. The
idea of going about with Hobson at her heels
was intolerable for the girl who had spent the
first sixteen years of her life in New York.</p>

<p>She finally carried her point, and also obtained
permission to read to her aunt for an
hour before going out. It was a particularly
dull weekly that was chosen, but she read as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
well as she knew how, and had the pleasure of
seeing Mrs. Delansing's stern face relax into
something like cheerfulness as she went through
two chapters of the vapid, semi-religious story.
At length the cold, gray eyes closed; the stately
head nodded forward; Aunt Emily was asleep.
Hildegarde read on for some time, till she was
sure that the slumber was deep and settled.
Then she sat for a moment looking at the old
lady, and contrasting her face and form, rigid
even in sleep, with those of dear Cousin Wealthy
Bond, who always looked like the softest and
most kissable elderly rose in her afternoon nap.
"Poor soul," she said, softly, as she slipped out
of the room to find Hobson. "So lonely, and
so unloved and unloving! I can't bear to hear
Blanche and Violette speak of her,&mdash;I can
hardly keep my hands off them,&mdash;and yet&mdash;why
exactly should they be fond of her? She
is not fond of them, or of anybody, I fear, unless
it be Hobson."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The visit was paid, and Hildegarde took her
way towards the Woman's Exchange, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
beating heart. It beat happily, for she had
enjoyed the half-hour's talk with the kind
cousin, an elderly woman, who seldom moved
from her sofa, but whose life was full of interest,
and who was the friend and confidante of
all the young people in the neighbourhood. She
had heard with pleasure of the proposed plan,
and had given Hildegarde a note to the manager
of the Exchange, whom she knew well; had
tasted a crumb of one of the cakes, and predicted
a ready sale for them. Moreover, and
this was the best of all, she had talked so wisely
and kindly, and with such a note of the dear
mother in her voice, that Hildegarde's homesickness
had all floated away, and she had decided
that it was not, after all, such a hardship to
spend three days in New York as she had
thought it an hour ago.</p>

<p>As I said, she took her way towards the
Exchange, carrying her neat paper box carefully.
As she went, she amused herself by
building castles, <i>&agrave; la</i> Perrette. How many
things she would buy with the money, if she
sold the cakes; and she should surely sell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
them. No one could resist who once tasted
them, and she had made several tiny ones
for samples; just a mouthful of "goody" in
each.</p>

<p>Fine linen, several yards of it, and gold
thread, and "Underwoods" in green morocco,&mdash;that
was really <i>almost</i> a necessity, for
Mamma's birthday; and some pink chiffon
to freshen up her silk waist, and&mdash;and&mdash;here
she was almost run over, and was shouted
at and seized by a policeman, and piloted gently
to a place of safety, with an admonition to
be more careful.</p>

<p>Much ashamed, Hildegarde stood still to
look about her, and found herself at the very
door of the Exchange. She went in. The
room was filled with customers. "I ought
to have come in the morning," she said to
herself, and the quick blush mounted to her
cheeks, as she made her way to the counter
at the back of the shop, where a sweet-faced
woman was trying to answer four questions
at once.</p>

<p>"No, the Nuns have not come in yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Yes, they are generally here before this. No,
I cannot tell the reason of the delay. Yes, it
happened once before, when the maker was
ill. I do not know why more people do not
make them. Yes, just the one person, so far
as I know. Marguerites? Yes, madam,&mdash;in
one moment. The orange biscuits will come
in at two o'clock. No, we have never had them
earlier than that. Perhaps you are thinking
of the lemon cheese-cakes. These are the
lemon cheese-cakes."</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and looked anxiously
round. It was plain that she was expecting
assistance, and equally plain that it was late
in coming. Hildegarde stepped quietly round
behind the counter.</p>

<p>"Can I help you?" she whispered.</p>

<p>The lady gave her a grateful glance. "I
should be so thankful," she murmured. "All
these ladies must be served instantly. The
prices are all marked."</p>

<p>The lady who had demanded the "Nuns"
had also paused for breath, being stout as
well as clamorous; but she now returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the attack. Hildegarde met her with a calm
front, and eyes which tried not to smile.</p>

<p>"Can you&mdash;oh! this is a different person.
Perhaps <i>you</i> can tell me why the Nuns are
not here. It really seems an extraordinary
thing that they should not be here at the
usual time."</p>

<p>"The messenger may have lost a train, or
something of that sort," suggested Hildegarde,
soothingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that would be no excuse! No
excuse at all! When one is in the habit of
supplying things to people of consequence,
one must not lose trains. Now, are you <i>perfectly
sure</i> that they have not come? You know
what they are, do you? Little round cakes,
with a raisin in the middle, and flavoured with
something special. I don't remember what
the flavour is, but it is something special, of
that I am sure. Have you looked&mdash;have you
looked everywhere? What is in that box at
your elbow? They might have been brought in
and laid down without your noticing it. Oblige
me by looking in that box at your elbow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden thought flashed into Hildegarde's
mind; she began to unfasten the box, which
was her own, whispering at the same time
into the ear of her companion in distress.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, yes, certainly!" said the latter,
also in a whisper. "Anything, I am sure, that
will give satisfaction! If you can only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop her noise," was evidently what the
patient saleswoman longed to say; but she
checked the words, and only gave Hildegarde
an eloquent glance, as she turned to meet
a wild onset in demand of macaroons.</p>

<p>Perhaps Hildegarde's fingers trembled a little
as she untied the narrow blue ribbon that bound
up her hopes; perhaps she was purposely slow,
collecting her thoughts and words. The stout
lady fumed and fidgeted. "You should never
allow things to be tied in a hard knot! It
should be one of the first rules in a place like
this, that boxes should be fastened with india-rubber
bands. Surely you know the usefulness
of india-rubber bands? I hope those Nuns are
fresh. If you did not see them come in, or
speak to the person who brought them, how can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
you be sure of their being fresh? Stale cakes
are out of the question, you know; nobody
could think of enduring stale cakes; and Nuns,
in particular, must be eaten the same day
they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These are not Nuns, madam," said Hildegarde,
as she opened the box. "Perhaps you
would like to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Not Nuns!</i> Then why did you tell me they
were Nuns? What are they, I should like to
know? H'm! ha! very pretty! What do you
call these?"</p>

<p>"Novices!" said Hildegarde, with a flash of
inspiration.</p>

<p>"Aha! Novices, eh? Yes, yes! a good name,
if they are&mdash;are they something new? I have
never seen them here before."</p>

<p>"Entirely new!" Hildegarde assured her.
"This is the first box that has ever been
brought in."</p>

<p>"Eh? the first? Then how do you know they
are good? How can you conscientiously recommend
them? I always expect conscientious
treatment here, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you try one?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde handed her the box; and she was
soon crunching and nodding and smiling, all
at the same moment.</p>

<p>"De-licious! I assure you, delicious! something
entirely new&mdash;Novices! Why, they are
exactly what I want for my party to-night.
Much better than Nuns,&mdash;Nuns have really
become quite tiresome. What is the price of
the Novices?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde hesitated, and glanced at the
saleswoman. The latter leaned swiftly forward,
looked, tasted a crumb,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Five cents apiece!" she said, quietly. Five!
Hildegarde had thought of three, and had built
all her castles on that basis.</p>

<p>But the stout lady was crying to heaven
against the price. "Impossible! absurd! Why,
Nuns were only two cents apiece, Marguerites
only three! The price was ridiculous, exorbitant.
She could not think of paying&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here a small lady, richly but quietly dressed,
came up, and looked at the box. "Pretty!"
she said. "Graceful and ingenious! Five cents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
apiece, you say? Give me a dozen and a half,
please! I should like to have them sent
to me once a week for the season; they are
just the things to please my daughter's lunch-club."</p>

<p>She nodded kindly to Hildegarde, and passed
on. The stout lady gazed after her reverentially.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cameron Pine!" she murmured. "She
will make them the fashion instantly. I&mdash;I will
take the rest!" she cried, wildly. "Put them
up, and send them to me,&mdash;Mrs. Newcomb
Rich, Madison Avenue. Send me two dozen
every week,&mdash;wait! send them the <i>day before</i>
you send Mrs. Pine's, do you hear? the day
before! Don't forget! It is most important!"
and puffing and nodding, she, too, went on.</p>

<p>There was a little lull now, during which the
saleswoman turned to thank Hildegarde so heartily
that our heroine would have felt well repaid
even if she had not sold all her cakes.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine where Miss Berden is;
she is always so punctual. This is our busiest
day, and one of our busiest hours, and some
of the ladies, as you saw, rather hard to please.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I really don't know what I should have done
if you had not helped me; it was very kind
and thoughtful of you." She gazed earnestly
at Hildegarde, and added, "You have a good
mother, I know, who has taught you to think
and help."</p>

<p>Hildegarde nodded and smiled, but said nothing,
for the tears came springing to her eyes.</p>

<p>"And you sold all the pretty cakes!" added
the saleswoman. "I knew they would make a hit
the moment I saw them. That was partly why
I put a good price on them; but it was also
because I knew there must be a good deal of nice
and careful work in making them. I wonder&mdash;you
have been so good, I am ashamed to ask
you anything more, but there is no one here now;
would you be willing to hold the fort while I run
to the corner and post a letter?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde assented cheerfully, and Miss
Adams (for by this name she now introduced
herself) put on her hat and went out. Hildegarde
remained mistress of the situation, and occupied
herself in tidying up the marble counter,
brushing away the crumbs, and rearranging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
some biscuits that had fallen from their dainty
pyramid.</p>

<p>Now voices were heard at the door, and
a gay group entered. A splendid carriage
stood without, and these rustling, high-plumed
ladies had evidently just dismounted from it.
There were four of them, and they were joined
in another moment by two or three more. Apparently,
all had been at some concert, for they
were talking all at once, and Hildegarde heard
the words, "Exquisite!" "Technique!" "Andante!"
etc., repeated over and over. She
became interested, and forgot for the moment
her position, when something curious recalled it
to her. She recognised, in one of the younger
ladies, her cousin Blanche Van Dene, one of
Mrs. Delansing's granddaughters; and almost at
the same instant, she became aware that Blanche
had recognised her, and that she was anxious to
avoid any open recognition. Her eyes had met
Hildegarde's for one second; the next, she had
turned her back squarely, and was chattering
volubly in the ear of her neighbour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 348px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;HILDEGARDE GRAHAME, IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT&#39;S WONDERFUL!&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A wave of anger surged over Hildegarde, leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the very tips of her ears pink as it receded;
but the wave of amusement followed it quickly,
and the second wave bore a little spray of malice.
Should she call to her, and say, "Dearest Blanche,
how is your dear mother?" Or she might put on
a twang&mdash;Hildegarde had an excellent twang at
her disposal, and say, "Hello, Blanchey! Haow's
yer haalth, and haow's the folks to home?" Oh!
it would be fun! And surely the girl deserved it!
Such bad form, to say nothing of bad feeling!
But here Hildegarde seemed to hear a certain
familiar voice saying, "My dear, a debt of rudeness
is one that should never be paid!" So she
held her tongue, and contented herself with looking
hard at Blanche's back, which showed consciousness
and discomfort in every line.</p>

<p>So intent was Hildegarde on her cousin's
back, that she did not notice that one of the
other ladies had turned round, and was gazing at
her in perplexity; next moment a shout rang out,
in a clear, joyous voice that made every one start.</p>

<p>"Hilda Grahame, in the name of all that
is wonderful! My dear, what sky have you
dropped from?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde started, and saw a splendid vision
advancing towards her with outstretched hand.
A girl somewhat older than herself, with the
walk and figure of a goddess and the dress of a
queen; a face of almost faultless beauty, and
large clear eyes through which looked a soul
like a child's; she was one of the famous beauties
of the day, famous alike for her loveliness,
her great fortune, and the pride of her ancient
name.</p>

<p>"My dear," she repeated, taking both Hildegarde's
hands in hers, "what sky have you
dropped from, and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Dear Imperia!" said Hildegarde, calling her
by the old familiar school name that came naturally
to her lips. "How delightful to see you! I
am selling cakes; will you have some? There
were some that I made myself, but they are all
sold. Here are various others, doubtless inferior,
but still good."</p>

<p>"Of course I will have some!" cried Imperia.
"Why, this is perfectly delightful! Do you really
come here? regularly, I mean, and have all the
cakes you want? I never heard of such fun. Give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
me three dozen of everything, and we'll have a
carouse. Here, girls!" she turned and called to
the others, who were looking curiously at the
two; "come here, and tell me who this is!
Shade of Madame Haut-ton, hover over us, and
bless this reunion!"</p>

<p>"Hildegarde Grahame! Hilda! Queen Hildegarde!"
cried several voices; and Hildegarde
was instantly surrounded by the crowd of butterflies,
all caressing and questioning, laughing
and talking at once. One or two looked puzzled,
other one or two sad, as they saw their
gay schoolmate of former days standing behind
the counter, quiet and self-possessed, and apparently
entirely at home. But visible distress was
on one countenance, and Hildegarde, charitable,
refrained from looking at her cousin, when
Imperia exclaimed, "Why, here is Blanche Van
Dene! She is your cousin, isn't she? Blanche,
here is Hilda, who used to be so good to you at
school, and help you with your spelling. Dear
me, Hilda, <i>do</i> you remember how Blanchey used
to spell?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde shook hands with her cousin composedly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and only her dancing eyes showed any
consciousness of the situation. Blanche muttered
some greeting, and then recollected an
engagement and hurried off. The lady Imperia
looked after her with good-natured contempt.</p>

<p>"Same little animal, my dear! I beg your
pardon, Hilda, but really, you know, we remember
her in her pinafores, and she was a snob
then. But now tell us all about it, like a good
girl! You are not in trouble, dear old thing?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and Miss
Adams came hurrying in, breathless and apologetic.
There had been a block in the street&mdash;she
was on the wrong side and could not get
back&mdash;would Hildegarde <i>please</i> excuse her for
being so long?</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have had a delightful time, Miss
Adams!" cried Hildegarde. "And I have sold
three dozen of everything&mdash;was that a real
offer, Imperia?"</p>

<p>Imperia vowed that it was; and Hildegarde
and Miss Adams together tied up the parcels,
while all chatted together like old friends. The
situation was explained, and so many dozens of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
"Novices" were ordered for every week that
Hildegarde declared her intention of taking back
with her to Braeside a <i>chef</i> and three kitchen-maids
to help her in the manufacture. Finally,
she was whirled away in her friend's purple
chariot for a drive in the park, and had the
pleasure of passing her cousin Blanche on the
way, looking sad and sorry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>MORE GREETINGS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> you won't think better of it? Hilda, I
am in despair! Think of it, my dear! Calv&eacute;,
and both the De Reszkes&mdash;there will never be
such a performance again, perhaps, in our lifetimes!
And all the good time we should have
between the acts&mdash;and our box will be simply
<i>full</i> of people all the evening&mdash;oh, you must
come, Hilda Grahame!"</p>

<p>People said of Helena Desmond that if she
had a fault, it was that of speaking too loud.
She was so full of the joy of living, so powerful
and vigorous in all her emotions, pleasurable or
painful, that her clear, resonant voice was apt to
be heard like the sound of a trumpet, dominating
other and feebler organs. Mrs. Delansing,
sitting erect behind her tea equipage, heard it,
and shivered slightly; but Hildegarde's reply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was spoken so low that she could not catch a
syllable. Then came: "No, no, I shouldn't!
Don't tell me! I should do nothing of the sort!
We are to take our opportunities as they come,&mdash;time
enough for sacrifices when Lent comes.
You know I don't mean that, Hilda; and you
know you are a dear, dear,&mdash;" here followed the
sound of good hearty kisses, and Mrs. Delansing
shivered again; then the door closed with a solid
slam, and all was silent.</p>

<p>Hildegarde came into the room, her hands full
of roses.</p>

<p>"Aunt Emily," she said, "Helena Desmond
sent you these! She would have come in, but
she was late already for a reception. Aren't
they lovely?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing bent her head over the flowers;
they were among the few things she enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" she said. "It was very kindly
done of Miss Desmond. I should have been
glad to see her. Was&mdash;was that she at the
door, speaking so loud?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hildegarde. "She was speaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rather loud, perhaps; but her voice is so
musical, I don't think one minds it in her, somehow.
She is a glorious creature!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Delansing seemed absent and disturbed.
"She&mdash;it is not always possible to avoid overhearing
portions of conversations, when carried
on in a high key&mdash;I gathered that some invitation
had been extended to you, Hildegarde&mdash;for
this evening."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Hildegarde, rather reluctantly.
"She wanted me to go to the opera with her,
but I didn't think I would better."</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded her aunt, severely.
"Miss Desmond is not accustomed to have her
invitations refused,&mdash;and you are bound to take
advantage of such opportunities as may present
themselves to you, living in the extraordinary
way that your mother thinks suitable for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" said Hildegarde, "Helena understood
perfectly, and I thought it best not to go."</p>

<p>She was arranging the flowers as she spoke,
and did not see the curious change that seemed
to come over Mrs. Delansing's face. It was as
if the stony repose of her features were broken,&mdash;some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
shifting light seemed to pass over her,
changing into shadow, but a shadow softened
into something approaching tenderness.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde, it is not on my account that
you are making this sacrifice? I cannot permit&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hildegarde looked up; then laid down her
roses, and crossed the room to lay her hand
on her aunt's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Of course it is, Aunt Emily!" she said,
impulsively. "I came here to see you, not to
go to the opera. I have been out already more
than I should to-day, but&mdash;but things happened,
somehow. And this is the last evening
we shall have together, and you know we are to
play the grand final rubber; and&mdash;and I <i>wanted</i>
to stay."</p>

<p>The old lady began to tremble in her chair;
a mist came over her keen black eyes.</p>

<p>"My grandchildren would have gone!" she
cried. "Blanche and Violette would have gone,
and not have thought it necessary even to tell
me. I have done everything for them, and
nothing&mdash; Blanche has been here this afternoon!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
she added, in a different voice, struggling
for her usual composure. "She said&mdash;but
it is of no consequence what she said."</p>

<p>"No, it really isn't, Aunt Emily!" said Hildegarde,
venturing to stroke the silken shoulder
affectionately. "Suppose we don't mind about
Blanche now; she is very young for her age,
don't you think? I can finish that story before
I go to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Delansing had something else to
say.</p>

<p>"Thomas Ferrers came to see me, also!"
she said. "Did you ask him to do so?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;no!" said Hildegarde. "I&mdash;I only
told him that you did not go out very much,
and&mdash;and he said at once that he should come
to see you before he left town."</p>

<p>"He is grown an old man!" said Mrs.
Delansing. "Wild Tom Ferrers! We had a
great deal of talk; much of it about you. I am
bound to say that he gave me a different impression
of your life. You&mdash;you must all be very
happy there together!"</p>

<p>The tone was piteous in its wistfulness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Hildegarde responded heartily. "You must
come and see for yourself some day, Aunt
Emily! We <i>are</i> happy, as happy as the day
is long!"</p>

<p>The evening passed quickly and pleasantly.
Mrs. Delansing unbent more than Hildegarde
could have supposed possible, and even smiled
as she told, over the backgammon board, some
anecdotes of Colonel Ferrers's wild youth. One
could not imagine her laughing under any circumstances,
but her smile, when she was amused,
was fine and delicate, and made a wonderful
difference in her face.</p>

<p>When bedtime came, she held Hildegarde's
hands in hers for several minutes, looking at her
with a searching gaze.</p>

<p>"You have not found it too dull?" she said.
"Hobson says she heard you singing in your
room to-day! You do not find this a dreary
cage, where no young life could be happy?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde had found it so the first day, but
now all was changed, and she could answer
heartily, "No, indeed, Aunt Emily! I have
had a very pleasant visit, and I am&mdash;oh, <i>so</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
glad I came! I don't believe I should ever
have known you if I had not been here in the
house; and I am very, very glad to know you,
Aunt Emily. May I come again?" She bent,
and kissed the old lady's cheek, and was delighted
to have her kiss warmly returned.</p>

<p>"Come whenever you will, my child!" Mrs.
Delansing said. "Come as often as you can;
I shall be better for every time I see you."</p>

<p>So it was arranged that later in the winter
Hildegarde was to come to Gramercy Park for
a good visit, and hear the German opera; and
when the aunt and niece finally said good-bye at
the bedroom door, Hildegarde felt that she had
made a new friend; while the lonely old woman
went to bed with a warmer heart than she had
felt in her bosom for years.</p>

<p>"Why, mum," said Hobson, "I declare to
goodness, you look ten years younger since that
young lady come here!"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> ten years younger, Hobson!" said
Mrs. Delansing, gravely. "I will have the
nightcap with the Valenciennes frill, if you
please."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde sent her little trunk off by the
expressman, and after bidding good-bye to Hobson,
who begged her most earnestly to come
again soon, started off for her final shopping-bout.
She had some idea of lunching at Purcell's,
and taking an afternoon train for home.
There were still several things to be attended
to, and she might&mdash;it was not very far from
Blank &amp; Blank's&mdash;she might be able to run
round and see if Rose Flower were at home.
It was doubtful, for she had been away most
of the fall, but there was always a chance of
her having returned. The dear Rose! How
good it would be to see her, and Doctor Flower,
and, perhaps, Bubble!</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock before she reached
Blank &amp; Blank's, and the vast shop was filled
with a surging crowd of women, young and old,
smart and dowdy, rich and poor. Here and
there a lone man was seen, standing bewildered,
with a sample in his hand of something that he
was to match; here and there, too, stood the
floor-walkers, in calm and conscious dignity,
the heroes of the shopping-world; but these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were only occasional flecks on the frothing tide
of womanhood. Hildegarde, after several vain
attempts, succeeded in reaching the counter she
sought. Before it stood a row of women, elbow
to elbow, each bent on her own quest; behind
it were the shop-women, endeavouring to satisfy
all demands at one and the same moment.</p>

<p>Endeavouring, most of them, that is; but even
the shop-woman, tried as she is in the furnace, is
not always pure gold. The young woman who
stood near Hildegarde may have been too tired,
or may have been ill; she certainly was rude.
Hildegarde had taken her stand directly behind
a plainly dressed, elderly woman, shrewdly judging
that she would be likely to make some
definite purchase and then depart, instead of
fingering half the goods on the counter, as
many of the customers were doing. The elderly
woman was evidently in haste. She
held up the black cashmere that she had been
examining, and said, civilly, "Will you please
tell me the price of this?" The question was
repeated several times; the shop-woman, after
one glance at the quiet, unstylish figure, turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
her shoulder, and began to press some goods
volubly on a departing shopper.</p>

<p>"Please!" said the quiet woman again. "I
am in haste, and want to buy some of this.
Will you please tell me the price?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait your turn, lady!" was
the reply; and voice and tone were equally ill-bred.
"I can't wait on everybody at once."</p>

<p>"I have been waiting fifteen minutes," was
the reply; "and my turn has come over and
over again."</p>

<p>That was enough for Hildegarde. She reached
over the woman's shoulder, and rapped sharply
on the counter. "Will you tell the lady the
price of this cashmere, or shall I call Mr.
Jones?"</p>

<p>The shop-woman looked up hastily, caught
sight of two blazing eyes, and a face like white
lightning, and quailed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm sure I was doing my best!" she
muttered. "It's sixty cents a yard."</p>

<p>"If this is your best, you have no place
here!" said the flashing person before her.
"How many yards would you like, madam?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
You shall&mdash;oh! oh, my dear! Oh, Nurse
Lucy, it is not really you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my blessed lamb!" cried Nurse Lucy,
"Am I awake or dreaming, I says to myself the
minute I heard your darling voice!"</p>

<p>And the stately maiden in blue serge, and the
gray-haired woman in black alpaca, fell on each
other's neck, and fairly cried for joy, while the
roar of the shopping actually ceased&mdash;for one
moment. Then it rose again,&mdash;what did it
matter to anybody, when a bargain sale was
on, who met or who parted? And the two
friends, holding each other fast by the hand,
got into a quiet corner apart, in a haven dedicated
to Marseilles quilts, which nobody was
buying, and sat down on two stools, and gazed
their fill.</p>

<p>"I wonder what is the meaning of it all!"
cried Hildegarde. "One after another, I keep
meeting all the people I care most about; first
one friend, and then another,&mdash;and now you,
you dear, blessed Nurse Lucy. Oh! what <i>are</i>
you doing here? and where is Mr. Hartley? and&mdash;and&mdash;have
you seen Rose and Bubble? I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was wondering whether I could find them.
And&mdash;oh, do tell me all about everything,
<i>please</i>!"</p>

<p>She paused, breathless, and Nurse Lucy took
up the tale, drying her joyful tears the while.</p>

<p>"My pretty! to think of it being you! and
me thinking of you miles away, and wishing I
could run down and see you and your blessed
mother, as you've asked me a many times so
kind. And Jacob,&mdash;why, he's right outside,
dear, waiting for me. He can't abear a crowd
of people, you know, and New York almost
smothers him anyway, poor soul. We came up
for the day, dear, to see Pinkrosia, and Bubble,
and the Doctor. We had a note from Doctor
Flower&mdash;ah! what a good man he is!&mdash;and he
wouldn't take no for an answer, but we must
come up and see them in their own home; and
so here we are,&mdash;came up on the early train
this morning, as Jacob had business in the city.
And now!&mdash;and my dear looking so well and so
beautiful, and the living spirit of her mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Nurse Lucy! you must not flatter
me!" cried Hildegarde. "See! there is your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
parcel all done up! I will take it for you; and
I don't think that young woman will neglect a
customer again for one while."</p>

<p>Arm in arm, they passed through the crowd.
As they reached the street, Mrs. Hartley pressed
Hildegarde's arm. "Hush, dear! stop a minute!
there's Jacob; waiting so patient, poor
soul! To think how surprised he will be!
What shall we say to him?"</p>

<p>"I know!" said Hildegarde. "Let me tell
him, Nurse Lucy!"</p>

<p>A tall, stalwart man was standing with his
back to them; his legs were rather wide apart,
his shoulders squared, and he seemed to have
planted himself against the throng of people
that hurried and jostled by him. Discontent
was visible in every line of his figure, and Hildegarde
knew just how his mouth was puckered,
though she could not see it.</p>

<p>Hildegarde stepped up softly behind him, and
spoke in his ear.</p>

<p>"And what do you expect to get for winter
wheat, Mr. Hartley?"</p>

<p>The farmer turned round as if he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
shot. "What in&mdash;now take me away! take
me away home, before I lose any senses this
place has left me. This ain't Huldy Grahame,
no way of the world!"</p>

<p>Convinced that it was that young person herself,
he seized her two hands, and drew her forcibly
along, as he made his way through the
crowd. "Lucy found ye?" he said. "I bet
Lucy found ye. Nothin' like women! I've been
thinkin' about ye all this blessed day, and looked
at every gal that went by, and they was about
ten thousand of 'em, and not one I'd look at
twice. Come along, Lucy! I've done all the
shoppin' I want! Let's get home to Doctor
Flower's, and have a sight at this gal, before I
wake up and find she's a dream!"</p>

<p>As the good man spoke, he hurried Hildegarde
along at a surprising rate, Nurse Lucy
following as best she might. Hildegarde was
fairly bewildered by all these sudden meetings.
She began to feel as if every street corner must
reveal some new vision; she looked for Bubble,&mdash;for
the Merryweathers; it seemed to her,
too, almost dreamlike in its strangeness. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
after all, there is nothing wonderful in meeting
all sorts and conditions of men in the course of
two days in New York.</p>

<p>A short walk brought them to a quiet, pleasant
street, where the usual brown stone houses
had rather a special look of care and neatness.
There were many flowers in the windows; the
curtains were more often muslin than lace, but
they were fresh and white, and one felt that it
was a pleasant neighbourhood, a neighbourhood
of homes.</p>

<p>"You have been here before, dear?" asked
Mrs. Hartley.</p>

<p>"No," replied Hildegarde. "I have been
meaning all the fall to come, ever since they
came back from Europe and took this house, but
one thing and another has prevented. As I told
you, I meant to try to see them to-day, in any
case. But Rose does not know I am in town;
it will be another surprise. Dear Rose!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do suppose Pinkrosia'll be glad
to see you!" said Jacob Hartley. "But if
she sets up to be as glad as Marm Lucy and
I be, she'll have to hear something, that's all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Huldy Grahame's my gal this time, and no
mistake!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde wondered what the Colonel would
say to this; wondered also if there were any
one else&mdash;but the thought dismissed itself unfinished.</p>

<p>Here they were now, in a pretty, homelike
parlour, hung with rose-colour,&mdash;ah! Doctor
Fowler always had the prettiest ideas!&mdash;waiting
for their hostess. A light step on the stairs!
As it came down, quickly and steadily, Hildegarde
saw many pictures, all in a moment.
First, a girl in a wheeled chair, pale and sweet-faced,
saying quietly that she could not walk,&mdash;that
she had not walked since she was three
years old,&mdash;pointing out the beauty and convenience
of her precious chair, in which she was a
prisoner. Then, herself, Hildegarde Grahame,
walking up and down the anteroom of the hospital,
waiting in an agony of suspense for news;
then her mother's face, and Doctor Flower behind
her, both smiling, and the blessed words,
"It is all right!"</p>

<p>The tears sprang to her eyes. Then came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the vision of their two selves, herself and her
friend, in their happy, happy holiday summer at
Cousin Wealthy Bond's; the gradual recovery,
the roses coming in the pale cheeks, the step,
growing ever firmer, more elastic. Then&mdash;but
there was time for no more. Here she was at
the door, Rose Flower, no longer a cripple, no
longer even an invalid, but the happy wife of one
of the best men in the world.</p>

<p>Rose's cry of surprise was very different from
the clarion shout with which Helena Desmond
had greeted her friend. It was soft and low,&mdash;a
note like that of a bird coming home to its
nest. "Hilda! my Hilda! oh, happy, happy
day!"</p>

<p>The two girls (for Rose was a girl still, if
she was a married woman!) held each other
close for a little, without a word; the words did
not come, nor was there need of them; each
knew the other's heart was full of love that
had had steady life and growth for five years.
"My dear!" they said; and then again, "My
dear!" and that was all.</p>

<p>But a few minutes later, when all four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
were seated in a circle, the girls hand in hand,
the old people looking from one to the other
with eyes of delight, the words came fast
enough.</p>

<p>Rose had to tell of her summer abroad, of all
the new worlds that had opened before the country-bred
girl,&mdash;worlds of which she had dreamed
all her life, which she had never thought to see
with her bodily eyes. Then Hildegarde must
tell of her summer, all the wonders of the
camp, the new friends, grown so dear in so
short a time; of Hugh and the Colonel, and
all the delights of Braeside and Roseholme;
and then both girls must hear all about affairs
at Hartley's Glen, from the greatest to the
least.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nurse Lucy, is the old yellow hen still
alive&mdash;Mrs. Whittaker, I mean? Surely you
know the hen we always called Mrs. Whittaker.
She used to tell us her name whenever she laid
an egg. And the cats! How are the dear cats?
Do you think Camaralzaman remembers me,
Nurse Lucy? And do you try to say his whole
name once in a while, so that he will not forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it? And how are all the people in the village?
How is Miss Bean? Does she still trim hats?&mdash; Oh,
Rose, do you remember the funny hats?
There was a green satin one, the first time I
went there&mdash;my dear! she wanted me to buy
it! But she was so good, and kind, and nice!
Everybody in the village is nice!"</p>

<p>"Hilda, do you remember when Bubble
sprained his ankle, and the letter he wrote
you? Oh, such a funny letter, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Remember it? I have it in one of my most
precious portfolios! But, oh, Nurse Lucy, you
haven't told us a word about the cows. Dear
cows! How are they all?"</p>

<p>And so on, and so on, happy, foolish talk,
with laughter breaking through it at every
moment, as one recollection brought up another.
And in the midst of it all, who is this tall youth
who comes silently into the hall, and stands
silent in the doorway, gazing at all the merry
talkers? No one sees him; he stands and looks
from one to the other, with shining eyes. A
slight, trim figure, well-dressed, alert, quickness
and energy in every line of it; a face not handsome,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
certainly, but so full of life and intelligence
and good-will that whoever looks at it
once is sure to look again. There he stands,
silent, absorbed; and so standing, he, too, sees
visions. A garden, and a boy at work in it;
a freckled, towsled boy, fighting weeds with a
hoe, but keeping one eye on a tattered spelling-book
that lies beside him. Ten weeds to
a word, that was the rule; big weeds, of course,&mdash;he
did not count chickweed. What was the
word,&mdash;ah! yes! <i>anticipate!</i> That was it!
And then he looked up, and saw the face looking
through the hedge,&mdash;the beautiful face,
with the proud, pretty mouth, and the bright
eyes. It had hardly changed, save that the
mouth was now gentle, instead of proud. And
then she came forward, and talked to him,&mdash;to
him, in his old shirt and trousers, and asked
about his lessons, and offered to teach him. Ah,
yes! that was the beginning of it all, the new
life, the new world, the new joy!</p>

<p>There was a suspicion of moisture in the
youth's bright blue eyes, but they twinkled
nevertheless; and when he spoke, it was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the old, homely speech that he loved, and in
the very words that he had spoken that day,
all these happy years ago.</p>

<p>"I swan!" said Zerubbabel Chirk. "I reelly
do! I swan to man!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MERRY WEATHER SIGNS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the best of all, perhaps, was telling about
it afterward. Sitting by the fire that evening,
in the pleasant sitting-room, Hildegarde told her
mother all about the Great Frisk, as she called
it; and it would have been hard to say whether
narrator or listener were the more interested.</p>

<p>"But, child," said Mrs. Grahame, "how was it
possible for you to do so much, and see so many
people in three days, or, rather, two days and a
half? I cannot comprehend it!"</p>

<p>"Nor can I!" laughed Hildegarde. "But&mdash;it
just happened, you know! Why, dear, it
seemed to <i>rain</i> friends! Wherever I turned
I ran into some one I loved. Oh, I feel so
rich,&mdash;rich in every way! The money in my
pocket is the least part of it all, and yet I am
glad enough of that, too. Only <i>think</i> of my getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
such a price! And eight or ten dozen to
send every week! It is like a fairy story, isn't
it, darling? And then to meet Helena,&mdash;dear
Helena! Oh, she was so delightful! And just
to see her was enough to fill one with beauty for
the whole day. She wears her hair brushed
back now,&mdash;you remember how it waves,&mdash;wonderful
hair! And she was in dark blue
velvet, trimmed with chinchilla, and&mdash;and altogether,
my love, if the Queen of Sheba had seen
her, her spirit would have died within her twice
over. And just the same dear, whole-souled
creature as ever! She never can change. She
promises to come out here before she goes to
Washington."</p>

<p>"That will be delightful!" said Mrs. Grahame.
"I shall be very glad to see Helena
again; I have always hoped that when she
came back you would see something of her
again. She was the one of your schoolmates
that my heart always warmed to. How came
Mrs. Desmond to be willing to leave Paris?
When she went away, she said it was for
life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Helena would come!" said Hildegarde.
"She told me about it; they must have had
a scene. She said to her mother, 'Mamma,
I am an American! I have never committed
any crime, and I refuse to be exiled from my
native country any longer. If you will come
with me, it will be much the pleasantest thing;
if not, I go alone.' Well, it was not the
thing to say, of course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not sure about that!" said Mrs. Grahame,
flushing slightly. "I am inclined to think
Helena was perfectly justified. When a woman
has not sense enough to guide her daughter, she
must submit to be guided. The idea of keeping
that girl over there five years, frittering about
the continent; preposterous! My sympathy is
entirely with Helena."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame sat very erect, and her eyes
were very bright; then, catching Hildegarde's
eyes, full of laughter, she relaxed her muscles,
and began to laugh too.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, dear," she said. "I never could
like Mrs. Desmond."</p>

<p>"I should think not!" said Hildegarde,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
promptly. "I should be under the painful
necessity of disowning you if you did. But you
love Mrs. Honiton, Mammina!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Honiton! how could two sisters
be so different? It is Margaret Honiton who
should be Helena's mother,&mdash;they are wonderfully
alike."</p>

<p>"Yes. Helena feels that. She is lovely with
her mother,&mdash;firm, but devoted,&mdash;but Aunt
Margaret is the one of the world to her. It is
a <i>terrible</i> thing for a girl to have an incompetent
mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, it is indeed," said Mrs. Grahame,
meekly. "I feel it so in your case. No,
don't kill me, Hildegarde! my time is not yet
come. Tell me more about Rose and her husband.
She is very happy, you say?"</p>

<p>"Happy as the day is long. I told you I did
not see Doctor Flower,&mdash;the only one I missed,
really; he was in Philadelphia. But their
house is as pretty as pretty; it is evident that
he furnished it,&mdash;you know what taste he has;
and everywhere roses, roses! carved and painted
and embroidered,&mdash;it is really the Rose-bower,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
as he calls it. Her own little sitting-room, up-stairs&mdash;oh,
such a little rosy-posy nest! rosewood
desk,&mdash;and everything soft covered with
rose-flowered chintz&mdash;curtains, too,&mdash;and the
most de-lightful sofa I ever did see! And her
little work-table, and&mdash;oh, well, Mammina, I
think, after all, that made me happier than anything,&mdash;unless
it was the sight of Nurse Lucy's
face when she recognised me! But, remembering
all that Rose suffered, and all the cramped,
anxious days and years, and then seeing her, a
rose in full bloom, in her own pretty house, with
such signs of loving care all about her,&mdash;it was
good, good!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Mrs. Grahame, heartily.
"I am sure that was a real treat, darling. And
Bubble&mdash;you say he is grown such a fine lad!"</p>

<p>"Bubble is enchanting! not handsome&mdash;well,
but you need not laugh, Mammina, for he is
<i>very</i> good looking, and certainly has an air of
distinction. He holds his head so well; and he
walks well, and, altogether&mdash;oh, I am proud
of Bubble. And Rose says that Doctor Flower
is sure the boy has a career before him; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
never had so apt a pupil. And he speaks such
beautiful English, Rose says."</p>

<p>"Rose says!" repeated Mrs. Grahame. "I
thought you had a good little talk with the boy
himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, so I had, but he <i>would</i> not talk anything
but the broadest Yankee. He insisted that he was
precisely the same freckled boy that he was when
I first saw him; and he carried on in the most
absurd way. He was almost like Gerald; dear
Gerald! I didn't see any of the Merryweathers,
Mamma; so there was something lacking, after
all."</p>

<p>"It would be a weary world if there were
not," said her mother. "But speaking of the
Merryweathers&mdash;have you noticed, Hilda dear,
whether the night is clear?"</p>

<p>"Whether the night is clear, Mammina? No,
I did not look. What do you mean, darling?
Shall I go to the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; not to the door," said Mrs. Grahame.
"Go to the window, child; the west window,
that looks across the hedge. Tell me if the
stars are out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Wondering greatly at this sudden solicitude
about the weather, Hildegarde crossed the room
and drew the curtain.</p>

<p>"Clear as a bell," she said. "Stars all out,
and wind,&mdash;oh, oh, Mammina! Why, there are
lights in the windows of Pumpkin House!
Mamma, they have come!"</p>

<p>She turned upon her mother with eyes alight
with happy inquiry.</p>

<p>"They have come," Mrs. Grahame repeated.
"Some of them, that is. Oh, things can happen
here as well as in New York, mademoiselle!
They came yesterday,&mdash;Mrs. Merryweather and
Kitty and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you never told me!" cried Hildegarde.
"And you have let me talk on and on for three,&mdash;four
hours,&mdash;oh, Mrs. Grahame!"</p>

<p>"You never asked me," replied that lady,
demurely. "You had a great deal to tell, and
I wanted very much to hear it; perhaps, too,
I did not want to have your mind distracted
until I had had my turn. Mrs. Merryweather
is looking very well."</p>

<p>"Oh, the dear!" cried Hildegarde. "Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Mammina, do you think I might go over? Do
you think it is too late? It is only half-past
eight. <i>Don't</i> you think I might run over now?"</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Mrs. Grahame, raising her
hand. "What is that?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde, in full tide of excitement, checked
herself, and listened. Under the window some
unseen hand swept the strings of a guitar,
lightly, yet firmly; and next moment a voice
broke out, singing the old air of "Gentle Zitella."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Under thy window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Maiden, I sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though the night's chilly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For this kind of thing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Weather is merry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hearts too are light;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Speak to thy Jerry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hilda the Bright!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hildegarde threw up the sash.</p>

<p>"Come in, Gerald!" she cried. "Oh, you
dear boy, I <i>am</i> so glad to see you&mdash;hear you,
rather! come in, quick!"</p>

<p>She shut the window hastily.</p>

<p>"Did you feel the air, Mamma? I thought if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I opened it just for a second,&mdash;the room seemed
pretty warm. Sure you are not cold, love?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame was quite positive; but Hildegarde
must feel her hands to make assurance
doubly sure; must tuck a shawl round her
mother's shoulders, and throw an encouraging
glance towards the fire, before she turned to the
door, which now opened to admit Mr. Gerald
Merryweather.</p>

<p>"You dear boy!" she repeated, going to meet
him with outstretched hand. "To think that
you have been here two days without my seeing
you. Gerald, how you have grown!"</p>

<p>"'Great weeds do grow apace,'" said the tall
lad, looking down on her. "I forestall the
remark, you observe. It is the one with which
I am commonly greeted by my affectionate
family. But it's awfully good to see you,
Hilda. I say, how well you're looking!"</p>

<p>"You, too," said Hilda. "And they are all
well? and all here, or coming? Oh, sit down
and tell me all about everything, do!"</p>

<p>"I have already told her, Gerald," said Mrs.
Grahame; "but I don't think she paid much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
attention; you may as well tell her over
again."</p>

<p>"Well, I was so excited, you see!" cried the
girl. "I have been having the most wonderful
time in town; and then to come out here and
find you,&mdash;my cup is rather brimming over,
that's all. Now tell, Jerry."</p>

<p>"We came," said Gerald, curling up his long
legs on the hearth-rug; "we have seen&mdash;several
things; we expect to conquer&mdash;shortly&mdash;the
dust, and to get the house to rights. Our
holidays&mdash;Ferguson's and mine&mdash;began on
Saturday, so the Mater thought we'd better
come right down and get things ready for the
others. Then she reflected that she could not
trust us; so she decided to come herself; then
she further reflected that she could not possibly
leave the kids alone with the Pater, so she brought
them along. Behold us! Bell and Toots arrive
next week, and the Codger at some time known
to himself. He is in Arizona, or somewhere this
side of it,&mdash;sent for to inspect a mine, and see
whether it is a good place for planting cabbages."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gerald!" said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Honoured miss!" replied the boy. "I may
not be quite accurate in the details, but there is
a mine, I do assure you."</p>

<p>"And what kind of winter have you all had?
You have been in Boston all the time,&mdash;that is,
your mother and father?"</p>

<p>"In Boston, yes. The winter has been such
as might have been expected, far from the
sun which etcetera. Barring the fact that we
have all existed in a state of acute anguish at
being separated from you, we have all been
exceedingly well, thank you."</p>

<p>"And how do you and Phil like college? Is
it as much fun as you thought it would be?
Do you like your rooms? Are you doing all
right in your Greek?"</p>

<p>"Hilda," put in Mrs. Grahame, "do let the
boy draw breath, and allow yourself to do so.
Two such panting young creatures I have seldom
seen. And Gerald is not going away on
the night train."</p>

<p>"I suppose not!" said Hildegarde. "But, oh,
it does seem so long since I have heard anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
about him and Phil. Bell, you see, writes the
most enchanting letters, but they are mostly
about college and music,&mdash;her college, I mean;
and she tucks in a little postscript to say that
all are well at home, and that is all the news
I get."</p>

<p>"Which accounts for your pallid and emaciated
appearance!" said Gerald.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Thy cheek, my love, of late a living rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which could the bulbul cheat with its rich hue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Looks pale&mdash;'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I don't remember any more. I learned that
in the Finden book, when I was six years old."</p>

<p>"Why, Gerald, did you have the Finden
books, too? How delightful! Dear, ridiculous
books! We have them now. I still think the
'Diamond' lady the most beautiful creature
that ever lived,&mdash;and simpered. But you are
not telling me a word about college!"</p>

<p>"I have had so much opportunity, you observe!"
said Gerald, appealing to Mrs. Grahame.
"My natural diffidence has been allowed
such free play by the silent and unconversational
attitude of your daughter&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame shook her head, and declared
that there was a pair of them, and she would
have nothing to say on either side.</p>

<p>Finally, however, boy and girl settled down
into an amicable and more or less coherent exchange
of information. It appeared that the
boys were doing well in college, enjoying the
new life to the full, and keeping well in their
classes.</p>

<p>"Of course we started in with about three
times as much sail as we could carry. I had
five courses, and Ferguson seven. But some
of them were half ones, and after the first term
we began to see where we were a bit,&mdash;and to
perceive that Roger and Pater were right. We
couldn't see it at first, of course, being such as
we are."</p>

<p>"And such as boys have been since the beginning
of colleges!" said Mrs. Grahame.</p>

<p>"Dear madam, how well you know! Well,
Greek has been pretty stiff, but still we peg away,
and like it no end. Then we both have Chem.
2,&mdash;that's great sport! I blew myself up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gerald!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fact, I assure you! Pounding something in
a mortar&mdash;nice little glass mortar, you know,&mdash;pounding
away, having fine sport; suddenly I
pounded a little too hard,&mdash;old Comprehensive
told us we must not pound hard,&mdash;and away
went the mortar, and away went I. My eyebrows
are only just growing out; and you never
noticed!" And the boy looked deeply injured.</p>

<p>"My dear boy! What a narrow escape! Oh,
your mother must have had a fright!"</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Gerald. "Roger, you know,
had that bad time ten years ago, and she thought
I had done something of that sort, and would
have to live on dark room and excruciating tortures
for months. But I got my eyes shut all
right, you see; so it only burned my hyacinthine
locks a bit, and took off my eyebrows, and
spoiled a good suit of clothes. But I learned
something, and now I pound the way old Comp
tells me to."</p>

<p>"What is the professor's name?" inquired
Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Comprehensive? Oh, well, his real name
is Worcester, you know. Of course no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
could stand that, and he is so short that it
would never do to call him 'Unabridged,' so
I suggested 'Comprehensive,' which is the size
you have in school, you know; and the fellows
took to it, and now he is called that altogether,
or 'Comp' for short."</p>

<p>"I see! By the way, what are you and Phil
called? Anything except your own names, I
suppose!"</p>

<p>"Pretty much!" Gerald admitted. "Phil is
called the 'Holy Poker'&mdash;don't know why, I'm
sure!&mdash;and 'Thumbling,'&mdash;he has grown about
nine feet, Phil has; really, he is a whole head
taller than I am!"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Hildegarde, innocently. "I
had no idea your head was so big as <i>that</i>, Gerald!
of course I knew it was <i>rather</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Grahame!" cried Gerald, in a tone of
anguish. "Will you speak to her, please? She
is trampling all over my delicate sensibilities,
and talking slang besides!"</p>

<p>"Hildegarde," said Mrs. Grahame, "I am
surprised at you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear madam!" said Hildegarde, meekly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"You didn't hear the things <i>he</i> said. Go on
with the names, Gerald!"</p>

<p>"They call him 'Bottle-washer,' too, and
'Cappadocia.' I think that is rather the favourite
name for Ferguson."</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> 'Cappadocia?'" asked Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there isn't really much reason,&mdash;but
then, it doesn't take much. They call me
'Capsicum,' you see, and we are twins, and 'Cappadocia'
begins,&mdash;surely I need explain no further
even to a person of limited intelligence?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Master Impudence! Do they call
you 'Cayenne,' too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! And 'Bricks,' and 'Mortar,'
and 'Flag,'&mdash;short for 'Conflagration,'&mdash;and
everything of that sort. I don't care; I don't
mind any of these; but when they call me
'Hamlet,' I knock them down."</p>

<p>"Dear Jerry! Why do they call you 'Hamlet?'"</p>

<p>"Oh! just some idiot started it,&mdash;you can't
tell how these things start. One comfort is,&mdash;I
called him the 'Grave-digger,' and it will
stick to him through college, for he looks it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the life. And the joke of it,&mdash;I don't
know whether it's safe to tell you the joke of
it, Hilda."</p>

<p>"Try and see!"</p>

<p>"Well, the real joke of it is that his father is
an undertaker, and I never knew it.</p>

<p>"But I haven't finished about the courses!"
he added, hastily, seeing Hilda look serious. "I
am taking French, and Ferguson German. We
have delightful conversations every evening, I
speaking my language, and he his. You shall
have a specimen when you see us togeth&mdash;Hullo!
What's that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame uttered a slight cry, and rose
hastily to her feet.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," she said. "I thought&mdash;I
surely did see a face looking in at the window.
Hark!"</p>

<p>They listened, and heard a rustling in the
great linden-tree outside. Then something
gleamed white at the window,&mdash;a face, beyond
all doubt.</p>

<p>"Ferguson!" said Gerald. "If I don't give
it to him for startling you, Mrs. Grahame; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
shall be flayed, I assure you! Set your mind
at rest on that point! Flayed an inch at a
time!"</p>

<p>"May I come in?" asked Phil's voice, as he
swayed back and forth on the linden branch.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Begging for a dole of crumbs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little Robin Redbreast comes!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Quick!" said Hildegarde, as she threw up the
window once more. "When will you boys learn
to move and act like reasonable mortals? How
are you, Phil? I am delighted to see you!"</p>

<p>Phil wriggled his length swiftly into the
room, and closed the sash with a single quick
movement. Then, after shaking hands warmly
with his two friends, he fixed a withering glance
on his brother.</p>

<p>"How about that box?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Now may Julius C&aelig;sar promote you to a
captaincy in the Skidmore Guards!" replied
Gerald, with great sweetness. "I clean forgot
the box, sweet chuck! And I just threatening
to flay you! Didst open it with thine own fairy
paws, beloved?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didst, beloved! And I intend to do the
same by thy head, at a convenient season.
He promised to be back in ten minutes," Phil
added, turning to Mrs. Grahame, "to open a
box for the Mater. I was putting up bookcases
the while. It's frightful, the way books
multiply in our family. I've put them up all
along all the up-stairs passages now, and
it gives us a little breathing-space, but not
enough."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea!" said Mrs. Grahame.
"We must remember that, Hilda; though,
indeed, there is still plenty of space in these
rooms."</p>

<p>"I wish there were in ours," said Phil.
"The disadvantage of the passage bookcase
is, that the whole family stops and reads as
it goes along, and we seldom get anywhere.
Which reminds me! I'm afraid I must go
back, Mrs. Grahame, and take this wretched
object with me. It is nearly ten o'clock, and
my Obadiah should have been tucked up in his
little nest some time ago."</p>

<p>"Your Obadiah will inquire into the condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of <i>your</i> little nest before he sleeps!" said Gerald,
threateningly.</p>

<p>"But remember that the Mater said the
next time we scrapped a bedstead to pieces,
we must sleep in the pieces. Come along,
Child of Doom!"</p>

<p>And with many hearty greetings, and promises
to meet the next day, the friends separated,
the boys saying good-night, and clattering off
down the stairs like a regiment of horse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMASING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day seemed to be largely spent in
running to and fro between the two houses.
Kitty and Willy were at Braeside before breakfast,
eager to embrace their dear Mrs. Grahame
and Hilda, and full of wonderful tales of school
and play. Then, as soon as Hildegarde had finished
breakfast, she must go back with them to
greet Mrs. Merryweather, and tell her how delighted
she was at their coming, and hear a more
detailed account of the girls' movements. Mrs.
Merryweather was sitting at her desk, with a pile
of papers before her, and books heaped as high
as her head on every side.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, after greeting Hildegarde
most affectionately, "I am just looking for the
girls' letter. It came this morning, and I put
it somewhere,&mdash;in quite a safe place, as I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the boys would want to see it, and then I meant
to send it on to your father,&mdash;I mean to their
father, of course. Here it&mdash;oh, no! that is an
old one! Now, this is really unfortunate, for
I was to send something to Gertrude, and I cannot
remember what it was. Dear me! I am
really too&mdash;would you mind saying over a few
things, Hildegarde, that she would be likely to
want? Perhaps it will come back to me; and
I can keep on looking all the while, not to lose
time."</p>

<p>Much amused, Hildegarde began to suggest,&mdash;"Boots,
hat, muff, handkerchiefs, gloves,"&mdash;but
at each article named Mrs. Merryweather shook
her head, and sighed as she sorted papers.</p>

<p>"No, dear, no! Thank you just as much;
but it was none of those. This only shows, dear
Hildegarde, the dreadful misfortune of being
unmethodical. I have no manner of doubt that
I have wasted at least ten good years of life in
looking for things. My sister-in-law, now, could
find a needle in a top bureau drawer at midnight,
without a moment's hesitation. It is a gift! I
trust you cultivate&mdash;now, you see, I may spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
half the morning hunting for this letter, when
I might&mdash;what amuses you, my dear?"</p>

<p>For Hildegarde's eyes were dancing, and her
whole face eloquent of fun.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Merryweather,&mdash;I know you will
excuse me,&mdash;but is not that the letter, pinned
to your dress? It looks like Gertrude's handwriting."</p>

<p>Mrs. Merryweather looked down, and gave
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"My child, your coming in was providential,
nothing less. Of course, I remember now, I
pinned it there for fear I should do&mdash;what
I thought I had done. Well, well! and it is a
Roman sash that the child wants,&mdash;I am sure I
should never have thought of that. Ah, dear!
I do miss my girls, Hildegarde. You see, they
inherit from their father a sense of order,&mdash;in
a measure,&mdash;and they help me a great deal.
Are my glasses on my forehead, dear? Whereas
Gerald and Phil are rather like me, I am afraid.
I wonder if Gerald has found his waistcoat yet?
He is wearing&mdash;ah, there he is now! Gerald,
you are really an object for a circus, my son."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="327" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;CONSIDER THE BEAUTY OF YOUR OFFSPRING.&#39;&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;CONSIDER THE BEAUTY OF YOUR OFFSPRING.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Gerald looked down thoughtfully at himself.
He was attired in white corduroy knickerbockers,
an ancient swallow-tail coat so large that
it hung in folds upon him, and a red velvet
waistcoat reaching to his knee.</p>

<p>"I hesitated about coming in," he said.
"Hildegarde is so susceptible, I fear the impression
I shall make upon her tender heart. The
lily is painted, the fine gold is gilded. Hilda,
confess that I am the dream of your existence."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Hildegarde,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Trunks not come yet; not mine, at least.
Upset a bath-tub over my only suit this morning,&mdash;lo,
the result! Wouldst not that I were
ever habited thus, mirific Mammy? Consider
the beauty of your offspring."</p>

<p>He seated himself on his mother's desk, drawing
the folds of the dress-coat about him, and
beamed upon her.</p>

<p>"If you would send him away, dear Mrs.
Merryweather," said Hildegarde, "I should be so
glad to help you a little with the papers and books.
I have a whole hour to spare,&mdash;do let me help!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, I should be only too thankful,"
said Mrs. Merryweather. "Jerry, go away, and
find something to do! You might unpack the
blankets, like a dear."</p>

<p>But Gerald declared that a wet blanket was
the only one with which he had any concern
after this cruel treatment, and retired weeping
bitterly, wiping his eyes with a long coat-tail.</p>

<p>Hildegarde devoted the morning to helping
her friends, and when she went home at noon
the rooms wore a very different aspect. The
books were all off the chairs and on the tables,
or in the bookcases.</p>

<p>"Not that it makes any permanent difference,"
said Mrs. Merryweather, plaintively.
"They <i>will</i> put books on the chairs, Hildegarde.
It is against the rules,&mdash;but it is their nature.
I made a rhyme about it once:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The book is on the chair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the hat is on the stair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the boots are anywhere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Children mine!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hildegarde especially enjoyed helping to arrange
the girls' room, tacking up the curtains,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and putting fresh flowers (from the Roseholme
greenhouse) in the vases. To-morrow she would
see those dear girls, and then who so happy as
she!</p>

<p>And to-morrow came, and with it Bell and
Gertrude, escorted by their father. All the
Merryweathers were now here, except Roger.
The question was on Hildegarde's lips several
times, "When will he come?" but somehow she
waited a little each time, and the moment
passed, till she heard Mr. Merryweather say:</p>

<p>"A letter from Roger, Miranda! He will be
here next week,&mdash;day uncertain, but surely in
time for Christmas."</p>

<p>A chorus of joy arose, in which Hildegarde
joined heartily.</p>

<p>"Think!" said Bell. "We have not seen
Roger since the summer; hardly since we have
seen you, Hildegarde. Oh, my dear, how long
it seems since camp! and yet when you look at
it the other way, it might be yesterday. Heigh,
ho! whose turn is it to get supper to-night? and
who is going to get the fish for the chowder?"</p>

<p>"Dear, happy days!" said Hildegarde. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
have not lost a minute of one of them, Bell.
If I should wake up to-morrow morning and
find myself at camp, I should not be in the
least surprised, but should just 'put the kettle
on and stand by to go about.'"</p>

<p>"Dear old camp motto!" said Bell. "It
makes a pretty good one anywhere, Hilda, do
you know? If they give me the class oration,&mdash;the
girls are talking about it,&mdash;I might take
that for my text."</p>

<p>"Are you talking camp and graduation," put
in Gertrude, who came into the room at this
moment, "when Christmas is almost here?
Oh, think of it, and we have not planned what
we are going to do, or&mdash;or anything!"</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, Gertrude," laughed Hildegarde.
"I have three bureau drawers full of
things ready, and I ought to be tying up a box
this minute, to go out West."</p>

<p>"Missionary box?" asked Bell.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;at least, not in the regular way.
But there are some distant cousins out in Colorado,&mdash;they
have a hard time to get along,
and there are a great many of them,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Mamma and I always send them a box at
Christmas. A kind of grab-bag box, with
clothes and whatever we can think of."</p>

<p>"My dear," cried Bell, sitting up with shining
eyes, "don't you want some contributions?
Let me tell you,&mdash;this is the position! We also
have such cousins,&mdash;fourteen in number,&mdash;in
Minnesota. And there was an auction at school,
and I got all kinds of odd picknickles and bucknickles,
thinking they would do for the box,&mdash;and
I returned to find that Mother had sent it off
three days ago, filled to overflowing. You see,
the boys are just behind ours in age and size, so
there are always lots of jackets (never any
trousers, of course), and she thought they
would be needed for the cold weather,&mdash;and I
forgot to tell her about my purchases. What
do you say, Hilda? Oh, come up into my
room, and see some of the things! They are
rather nice, some of them, and others just funny.
Come on!"</p>

<p>Away went the three girls, up to Bell's sunny
room, where the trunks stood open, with trays
of hats on the bed, and a general effect of "just-arrived-and-haven't-had-time-to-get-settled"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
pervading
all. Bell cleared a chair for Hildegarde,
and bidding Gertrude "perch where she could,"
began to pull things out of the big, brown trunk,
talking as she went.</p>

<p>"You see, girls, the way of it was this. There
is always an auction at the end of the year, and
generally things stay over for that; but this
time there had been a fire in the town, and a
good many poor families were left destitute.
Mrs. Tower suggested that, perhaps, we might
make up a little purse, or take charge of one
family for the winter. We agreed to do the
latter, and made up a committee to order coal
and wood, and another to make clothes for the
children,&mdash;seven children, poor little things!
and the father so badly hurt in saving the
youngest baby that he will not be able to work
for several weeks. Well, I was on the committee
to order the things; but when I came to
collect the money, some of the girls, who wanted
most to help, were very hard up, myself included.
So near the end of the term, you see,
and we had been buying Christmas things and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
all. So I said, 'Suppose we have an auction!'
for there were some girls&mdash;not many, but I
suppose there are a few everywhere&mdash;who
didn't care a bit about the poor family, and yet
we knew they had money, and we were bound
to get some of it. I had the sale in my room.
It was great fun. I hung out a red flag, and
posted flaming notices in all the halls and corridors;
and we had a great crowd. Me! oh, no,
I was not auctioneer! I could not possibly talk
fast enough. Caroline Hazen did it splendidly.
Her mother was Irish, and she can drop into
the most delicious brogue you ever heard, and
she was so funny, we were in fits of laughter all
the time. We made twenty dollars,&mdash;think of
it!&mdash;all in a little over an hour. And some of
these things I bought with what little money I
had, and the rest were just left over, and as the
girls would not take them back, I brought them
along for the box. See! here is a pair of knitted
shoes,&mdash;really perfectly new. Anna Waring
said that she had a dear aunt who sent her a
pair every Christmas and every birthday, and
she has ten pair now, and never hopes to catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
up. Three pair were sold beside these; got
them for ten cents, and see how pretty they
are!"</p>

<p>"Why, charming!" cried Hildegarde. "Bell,
why don't you wear these yourself?"</p>

<p>"I! Perish the thought! I never wear <i>any</i>
shoes in my room, Hilda; bare feet are part of
my creed."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you have no carpet here, dear,"
said Hildegarde, with a little shiver. "And it
must be very cold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Delightfully cold!" cried Bell. "I know
few things pleasanter than the touch of a good
cold floor to the bare feet on a winter morning."</p>

<p>"She is volcanic, Hilda!" put in Gertrude.
"She sleeps under a sheet all winter, and never
looks at a blanket; it is true!"</p>

<p>Bell nodded gaily in answer to Hildegarde's
horrified look. "No use, dear! I am hardened
in mind as well as in body, and cannot change
my ways. Look here! Perhaps one of the boys
might like this?"</p>

<p>She held up a string of chenille monkeys, and
danced them up and down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course he would," said Hildegarde.
"And what&mdash;what <i>is</i> that, Bell Merryweather?"</p>

<p>Bell looked rather ruefully at the object she
now drew from the trunk.</p>

<p>"Nobody else would buy it," she said. "The
girl who brought it down is new and shy, and&mdash;well,
somehow, you felt that she wanted to help,
and had nothing else to bring. I was so sorry
for her,&mdash;I gave my last quarter for it."</p>

<p>It was a long strip of coarse twine lace, with
a yellow ribbon quilted in and out its entire
length. One of those objects that sometimes
appear at fancy fairs, for which no possible use
can be imagined.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> queer," said Bell. "I suppose it must
have been meant for something; I didn't like to
ask her what."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, my dear, it is a lovely ribbon!"
said Hildegarde. "Why not take the ribbon
out, and make bows and things? I am sure
you must want ribbon for some of your Christmasings."</p>

<p>Bell confessed that she might, and the ribbon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was carefully laid aside, freed from its snarl of
twine.</p>

<p>"Here," said Bell, diving into the trunk again,
"is a highly interesting article, <i>mesdames!</i> a
pheasant, you see, carved,&mdash;Swiss, I suppose,&mdash;with
all his feathers spread out. Now, I think
I did pretty well to bring that home without
breaking. Is there a boy in your box, Hilda?
I meant this for a boy."</p>

<p>"There is, indeed, and I know he will be
enchanted with such a pretty thing. Oh, and
the marbles! Now, Bell, will you tell me what
college girls do with marbles?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Bell, laughing. "She&mdash;Martha
Sinclair&mdash;is very near-sighted, poor thing. She
thought these were moth-balls. She brought
a lot of them from home, and put them up with
her furs this spring, and was horrified to find
them&mdash;the furs&mdash;all moth-eaten this fall.
Poor Martha! That, Hildegarde, is the sad
tale of the marbles. They are very good ones!
I should not dare to let Willy see them,&mdash;here,
put them in your pocket! Here are assorted
pen-handles,&mdash;went in one lot,&mdash;forty cents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
for the dozen of them. Some of them are rather
nice, I think."</p>

<p>"This is a beauty!" cried Gertrude. "This
Scotch plaid one. May I have this, Bell?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear! Hilda shall have the pearl
one,&mdash;there! This is the prettiest, Hilda&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why am I to have all the prettiest?"
inquired Hildegarde. "You are very reckless,
Bell."</p>

<p>"No, my love, I am not," said Bell. "Pen-handles
are, generally speaking, a drug in this
family. For several Christmases Willy&mdash;dear
child!&mdash;could not think of anything else to
give us, so we had pen-handles all round&mdash;how
many years, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"Three, I think," said Gertrude. "Then some
one laughed, and hurt his dear little feelings,
and he never gave us any more. I miss the
Christmas pen-handle myself, for I always get
mine nibbled pretty short in the course of the
fall term. It is the only way I can possibly
write a composition."</p>

<p>"And is your next composition to be on the
'Scottish Chiefs?'" asked Hildegarde. "Or do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
you hope to cure yourself by the taste of varnish
and red paint?"</p>

<p>"Puppies!" cried Bell, emerging once more
from the depths of the trunk. "Five china puppies
in a row. And thereby hangs a tale."</p>

<p>"I don't see a sign of a tail," said Gertrude,
inspecting the five little terriers, all sitting up
very straight, with their paws exactly on a
line.</p>

<p>"Spell it the other way, miss; and don't forget
your Shakespeare," said her sister.</p>

<p>"This reminds me of the very most foolish
charade I ever heard. We were playing one
evening in Martha Sinclair's room; and Janet
Armour took this row of puppies from the mantelpiece
and set it on the floor, and told us to
look at it. Then she kicked it over with her
foot, and told us it was a word of three syllables,
all three and the whole word given
at once. See if you can guess, Hildegarde?
You give it up? Well, it is too silly to guess.
'Kick-a-row,' do you see? Cicero, Gertrude,
my lamb. I explain on account of your tender
years."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"She must be a silly girl," said Gertrude.
"We wouldn't put up with such a poor charade
as that here, would we, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"There are different kinds of brains," said
Bell, laughing. "Janet Armour leads the whole
college in mathematics, and is head of the basket-ball
team. So you see, dear, talents vary.
Well, Hildegarde, I am afraid there is nothing
else that would do; unless you would like this
cologne-bottle doll? She is a superior doll."</p>

<p>"Very," said Hildegarde. "And you know
Kitty would be enchanted with her. No, Bell,
I shall take nothing else, and I am ever so much
obliged for all these nice things. Now you
must come over with me and help me fasten up
the box. You, too, dear Gertrude."</p>

<p>The three raced across the lawn and through
the hedge, and were soon in Hildegarde's room.
Bell looked round her with a sigh, half admiration,
half regret.</p>

<p>"Hilda, there is no room but this!" she said.
"How do you make it so&mdash;so&mdash;well, your own
portrait in a way? If I were to be shown into
this room in the furthest corner of the Soudan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I should say, 'And is Hildegarde in, or shall I
wait for her?'"</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed, and looked about her,
her eyes resting lovingly on this or the other
treasure of picture or book.</p>

<p>"Dear room!" she said. "I am glad you like
it, for I love it very much. And if it looks like
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must be pretty good-looking!" cried
Gertrude. "Is that what you were going to
say, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"No, you absurd child, it was not. But&mdash;well,
girls, of course it is different when people
have two or three places, in town and country,
and move about as you do, to and from school
and college, and all that. But this, you see, is
my home, my only home and abiding-place; and
so my own things grow to be very real to me,
and very much a part of my life. I suppose
that is it. I know&mdash;you will understand what
I mean, Bell&mdash;whenever I go out of this room,
it seems as if one part of me stayed here, and
was ready to greet me when I came back. But
that is enough about me," she added, lightly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"Here is the box! Now we shall see how nicely
all Bell's prettinesses will fit into the corners!</p>

<p>"This is Mamma's present for Cousin Ursula.
A nice, fat down puff, for her feet in winter; it
is very cold there, and she is not strong, poor
dear. And I trimmed this hat for Mary, the
daughter. Rather pretty, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Rather pretty!" cried both girls. "Hilda,
it is a perfect beauty! Oh, how did you learn to
do these things? Will you trim all our hats for
us, for the rest of our lives?"</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," said Hildegarde,
laughing. "I learned all I know from my
mother. She <i>is</i> clever, if you will. I cannot
compare with her in skill. Yet I was once
offered a position as assistant to a milliner.
These things underneath are things we have
worn, but they are all good."</p>

<p>"This has never been worn!" exclaimed Bell,
lifting a pretty gray silk blouse, trimmed with
knots of cherry-coloured ribbon. "This is just
out of the box, Hildegarde. Oh, what a pretty,
dainty thing!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed. "I am proud of that!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
she said. "I made that out of an old underskirt
of Mamma's. Yes, I did!" as the girls
exclaimed with one accord. "It was good silk to
begin with, you see. I washed it, and pressed it,
and made it up on the other side; and it really
does look very nice, I think. The ribbon is
some that Mamma had had put away ever since
the last time they wore cherry colour,&mdash;twenty-five
years, she says. Lovely ribbon! Well, and
I knew that Mary, the daughter, is just my age,
so I had to 'run for luck,' and make it to fit me.
I do hope she will like it!"</p>

<p>"Like it!" exclaimed Bell. "If she does not
like it, she deserves to wear brown gingham all
her life. It is as pretty a blouse as I ever saw."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with brown gingham?"
asked Hildegarde. "One of my pet dresses,
a year or two, was a brown gingham."</p>

<p>"Oh, but not like <i>our</i> brown gingham!" said
Bell. "You see&mdash;well, it is treasonable, I
know, Gerty, but Hildegarde is almost like ourselves.
You see, our blessed Mammy (this was
long ago, when Toots was a baby, and the boys
still in kilts) got tired of all our clothes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
felt as if she could not bear to think about them
for a while. So she got a whole piece of brown
check gingham,&mdash;forty mortal yards,&mdash;and had
it all made up into clothes for us. Oh, dear!
Shall I ever forget those clothes? It was a
small check, rather coarse, stout gingham, because
she thought that would wear better than
the Scotch. It did! I had four frocks of it,
and the boys each had three kilt suits, and even
the baby wore brown slips. You cannot remember
it, Toots?"</p>

<p>Gertrude shook her head.</p>

<p>"I remember the effect on the family mind,"
she said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bell. "I don't know whether
you have ever noticed, Hildegarde, that none
of us ever wear brown? Well, we never do!
Pater will never see it. He did not realise for
some time what had been done. But one day,&mdash;oh,
you ought to hear the Mammy tell about
this! I can't begin to make it as funny as she
does. One day he came home, and the twinnies
were playing in the front yard. He stood and
looked at them for a while.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Are you making mud pies, boys?'</p>

<p>"'No, Papa!'</p>

<p>"'Then why have you on these clothes?'</p>

<p>"The boys didn't know much about their
clothes; he looked at them a little more, and
then he came into the house. There was I, in
my brown gingham, playing with my doll.</p>

<p>"'Great C&aelig;sar!' says Papa. 'Here's another!
Been making mud pies, Pussy?'</p>

<p>"'No, Papa! I am playing with my dolly.'</p>

<p>"'Do you get dirty, playing with your dolly?'</p>

<p>"'Why, no, Papa!'</p>

<p>"'Then why do you wear such things as
this?'</p>

<p>"I was just going to tell him that 'this' was
the dress I was wearing every day and all day,
when dear Mammy came out of the sitting-room
with the baby. And, Hilda, the baby wore a
brown gingham slip, and Mammy had on a long,
brown gingham apron.</p>

<p>"'Napoleon Bonaparte!' said Papa. 'Here's
two more of 'em.' Then he sat down on the
stairs, and looked from one to the other. Then
he went to the door and called the boys; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
took us all into the sitting-room, and stood us in
a row, and sat and looked at us.</p>

<p>"'Miranda,' he said, 'What have you been
doing here?'</p>

<p>"'Doing, my dear Miles?' said Mamma.
'What should I have been doing? Dressing
baby after her afternoon nap, to be sure.'</p>

<p>"'Dressing her!' says Pater. '<i>Dressing</i> her!'
Then he broke off, Mammy says, and put his
hand to his forehead, as if he were in a kind of
dream.</p>

<p>"'Miranda,' he said, 'I have been greatly
occupied for the last few weeks, and have not
fully realised what was going on. I have been
dimly aware that, when I came home, the whole
world seemed to turn brown and dingy. At
first I thought it was the weather; then I
thought it was the condition of business; at
last I began to think that my sight must be
failing, and cataracts forming, or something of
the kind, so that I could see nothing without a
brownish tinge over it. Now, I&mdash;I realise
what the matter is; and I ask what&mdash;<i>what</i> is
this stuff in which my family is masquerading?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Masquerading, Miles? I don't understand
you. This is brown gingham, a most excellent
material, inexpensive, durable, and neat. I
bought forty yards of it, so that the children
might all be dressed alike, and without all this
fuss and expense of different materials. You
know you said we must economise this summer,
and I&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Pater. 'Yes, I understand now.
Miranda, you are a good woman, but you have
your limitations.'</p>

<p>"He would not say another word, but went off
into the garden to smoke. We forgot all about
what he said, all but Mammy, and she thought
he would get used to the brown gingham in
time, and, anyhow, she had meant to do the best,
dear darling.</p>

<p>"Hildegarde, the next morning, when we all
came to dress, our clothes were gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" repeated Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Gone,&mdash;vanished; frock and kilt, slip and
apron. Not an atom of brown gingham was to
be found in the house. And the rest of the piece,
which Mammy had meant to make into a gown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
for herself, was gone, too. Mammy looked
everywhere, but in a few minutes she understood
how it was. She didn't say a word, but just
put on our old dresses, such as were left of
them. They were pretty well outworn and outgrown,
but we were glad to get into them. We
hardly knew how we had hated the brown gingham
ourselves, till we got out of it. Well, that
day there came from one of the big shops a box
of clothes; an enormous box, big as a packing-case.
Oh! dresses and dresses, frocks and pinafores
and kilts, everything you can imagine, and
all in the brightest colours,&mdash;pink and blue, yellow
and green,&mdash;a perfect flower-garden. White
ones, too, three or four apiece; and the prettiest
slips for Baby, and a lovely flowered silk for
Mammy. You can imagine how I danced with
joy; the boys were delighted, too, and as for old
Nursey, she beamed all over like an Irish sun.
When Papa came home that afternoon, we were
all dressed up, the boys in little white sailor
suits, I in a ruffled pink frock, and Mammy
and Baby most lovely in white and flowers.
He looked us all over again. 'Ha!' he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
'once more I have a family, and not a shoal of
mud-fish. Thank you, my dear.' And none
of us has ever worn brown since that day, Hildegarde."</p>

<p>"Poor, <i>dear</i> Mrs. Merryweather!" cried Hildegarde,
laughing. "I think it was pretty cruel,
all the same. And&mdash;did you ever find the
brown gingham?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that <i>was</i> naughty!" cried Gertrude.
"He buried it all in the back garden. That was
truly naughty of Papa. Mammy found them
there a week after, when she was setting out the
asters. They were all neatly laid in a box, and
buried quite deep down. But Mammy took
them up, and sent them to the Orphans' Home.
Dear Mammy!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>AN EVENING HOUR.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> what shall we play this evening?"
asked Mrs. Merryweather.</p>

<p>Hildegarde and her mother had been taking
tea at Pumpkin House. Hugh was there, too,
and now Colonel Ferrers had come in, so the
cheerful party was nearly complete.</p>

<p>"If we only had Roger and Papa!" sighed
Bell. "Nothing seems just right without the
whole clan together."</p>

<p>"We shall have them soon," said her mother.
"Meanwhile let us be merry, and honour their
name. It is too soon after tea for charades, I
suppose. Why not try the Alphabet Stories?"</p>

<p>"Alphabet Stories?" repeated Hildegarde.
"Is that a new game? I don't seem to remember
it."</p>

<p>"Brand-new!" cried Gerald. "Mater invented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it one evening, to keep us quiet when
Pater had a headache. Jolly good game, too.
Tell Hildegarde one or two of yours, Mater, to
show how it's played."</p>

<p>"Let me see! Can I remember any? Oh,
yes, here is one! Listen, Hilda, and you will
catch the idea at once. This is called 'The
Actions of Alcibiades:' Alcibiades, brilliant,
careless, dashing, engaging fop, guarded Hellas
in jeopardy, king-like led many nobles on.
Pouncing quite rashly, stole (though unduly,
violently wailing) Xerxes's young zebra.</p>

<p>"That is the story. You see, it must have
twenty-six words, no more, no less; each word
beginning with a successive letter of the alphabet."</p>

<p>"Oh! delightful! enchanting!" cried Hildegarde.
"Mammina, this is the very game for
you and me. We have been longing for a
new one, ever since we played 'Encyclop&aelig;dics'
to death. Tell us another, please, Mrs. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>"Let me see! Oh, but they are not all mine!
Bell made some of the best ones. I will give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
you another, though. This is 'A Spanish Serenade.'
Andalusian bowers, castanets, dances,
enraptured Figaro. Gallant hidalgo, infuriately
jealous, kittenish lady, made nocturnal orisons.
'Peri! Queen! Star!' Then, under veiled windows,
Ximena yielded. Zounds!"</p>

<p>"That is extremely connotative!" said Mrs.
Grahame. "This really is an excellent game.
Colonel Ferrers, shall we enter the list?"</p>

<p>"Not I, my dear madam. Curls my brain up
into bow-knots, I assure you. Clever people,
word-plays,&mdash;that sort of thing always floors me
completely. Delightful, you understand! I enjoy
it immensely, if I may be allowed to play
the listener. Let us hear some more, hey?
'Alcibiades'&mdash;hum, ha! How did that go?
Quite a ring to it, hey?"</p>

<p>"I have one," said Bell; "but it is a good
deal like Mammy's Spanish one. Still, perhaps
it will pass. It is called 'An Elopement.' Arbitrary
barber, charming daughter, engaging
foreigner, graceful, handsome, insinuating. Jealously
kept lady. Midnight nuptials; opposing
parent. Questing, raged savage tonsor,&mdash;'Ungrateful!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Vamosed with Xenophon Young?
Zooks!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that is a beauty!" cried Hildegarde.
"Where do you get your X's and Z's? I cannot
think of one."</p>

<p>"There aren't many," said Bell. "And I
rather fear we have used them all up. Try,
though, Hilda, if you can make one. I am sure
you can."</p>

<p>"Give me a few minutes. I am at work,&mdash;but,
oh, I must have pencil and paper. How
do you keep them in order in your head?"</p>

<p>"<i>Habeo! Habeo!</i>" cried Gerald, who had
had his head buried in a sofa-pillow for the
past few minutes. "Through all the flash of
words I have maintained the integrity of mine
intellect." (This was lofty!) "Hear, now, 'A
Tale of Troy.' Agamemnon brutally called
Diomed 'Elephant!' Fight! Great Hector,
insolently jocular, kicked Laced&aelig;monian Menelaus's
nose. 'O Ph&oelig;bus! Quit!' roared Stentor.
Turning, Ulysses valiantly waded Xanthus.
'Yield, zealots!'"</p>

<p>A general acclamation greeted Gerald's story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as the best yet. But Bell looked up with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>"Strike, but hear me!" she cried. "Shall
Smith yield to Harvard? Perish the thought!
Hear, gentles all, the tale of 'The Light of
Persia.' Antiochus, braggart chief, devastated
Ecbatana; finding golden hoards, invested Jericho.
Median nobles, overcome, plead quarter!
Rescuing, springs through underbrush, victorious,
wielding Xerxes's yataghan,&mdash;Zoroaster."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried both boys. "Good for you,
Smith College! That is a buster!"</p>

<p>"Boys!" said Mrs. Merryweather.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mater! We did not mean that. We
meant 'that is an exploder!'"</p>

<p>"You are very impertinent boys!" said their
mother. "Shall I send them away, Mrs. Grahame?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't!" said that lady, laughing.
"I am sure we have not had all the stories yet.
Phil, you have not given us one."</p>

<p>"Mine won't come right," said Phil, rather
ruefully. "I shall have to cheat on my X.
Have I leave?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;for once, perhaps," said his mother.
"It must not be a precedent, however. Let us
hear!"</p>

<p>And Phil gave what he called "A Mewl of
Music." "A bandit&mdash;cheerful dog!&mdash;enjoyed
fiddling. 'Go home!' insolently jawing ki-yied
local musician. 'Nay! Oh, peace, queasy rustic!
Take unappreciated violin. We execrate your
zither!'"</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Mrs. Merryweather. "That is
imperfect, but the first part is good. Next?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Hildegarde, rather timidly,
"I <i>think</i> I have one ready. I hope it is correct,&mdash;shall
I try it? It is 'The Sea.' Amid briny,
cavernous depths, entrancing fishes gambol, hilarious,
iridescent jewels. Kittenish, laughing mermaids
nod; or perhaps, quietly resting, softly
twine, under vanished wave-worn xebecs, yellow
zoophytes."</p>

<p>"My dear Hildegarde, that is the best of
all!" said Mrs. Merryweather, warmly. "That
is a little poem, a little picture. We shall have
nothing prettier than that to-night, and as we
must not overdo a good thing, suppose we stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the stories for this time, and try something
else. Where is our music, girls?"</p>

<p>Bell glanced at Hildegarde, and then at Colonel
Ferrers. She had heard something of the
passages between Jack Ferrers and his uncle,
and knew that classical music was not the thing
to make the Colonel enjoy himself. But Hildegarde
nodded brightly in return.</p>

<p>"Let us sing!" she said. "Let us all have
a good sing, as we used at camp. Where is the
old song-book?"</p>

<p>Bell, comprehending, fetched an ancient volume,
rubbed and thumbed into a comfortable
mellowness.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" she said. "Come, boys, now
for a chorus! Sing it as we used to sing it, sixteen
campers strong, etc."</p>

<p>The whole family clustered round the piano,
Kitty and Will and Hugh close beside Bell,
Hildegarde and Gertrude looking over their
shoulders, while Phil and Gerald did what the
latter called the giraffe act in the background.
And then they sang! One song after another,
each choosing in turn, the chorus rolling out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
nobly, in such splendid songs as "October,"
"A-hunting we will go," and "John Peel."
Then Hildegarde must sing "Annie Laurie"
for the Colonel, and she sang it in a way that
brought tears to the eyes of the ladies, and made
the Colonel himself cough a good deal, and go
to the window to study the weather.</p>

<p>"Ah, Colonel Ferrers," said Hildegarde, when
the sweet notes had died away, and it was time
for the silence to be broken, "where is the lad
who should play that for us, better than any
human voice could sing it? When shall we have
our Jack home again?"</p>

<p>The Colonel hummed and hawed, and said it
was absurd to suppose that any fiddle, however
inoffensive,&mdash;and he acknowledged that his
nephew's fiddle gave as little offence as any he
had ever heard,&mdash;still it was absurd to think
for an instant that it could be compared with
the sound of the human voice.</p>

<p>"Give me a young woman's voice, my dear
madam," he said, turning to Mrs. Grahame;
"give me that organ, singing a song with melody
and feeling in it,&mdash;none of your discordant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Dutch cobwebs, none of your Italian squalling,
or your French caterwauling, but a <i>song</i>,&mdash;a
thing which is necessarily in the English language,&mdash;and
I ask nothing more,&mdash;except that
the singer be young and good-looking."</p>

<p>"Are you so very reasonable, I wonder, as
you think, my dear Colonel?" said Mrs. Grahame,
laughing. "Surely we cannot expect that
every person who sings shall be beautiful."</p>

<p>"Then she has no business to sing, madam,"
said the Colonel. "My opinion,&mdash;worth nothing,
I am aware, from a musical point of view.
Now, when I was in Washington last week,&mdash;stayed
at a friend's house,&mdash;delightful people,&mdash;very
good to the Boy here. Weren't they,
Young Sir?"</p>

<p>"They were fountains in the valley!" said
Hugh. "They were ducks,&mdash;but they quacked,
instead of singing."</p>

<p>"Precisely! Exactly! The child has described
it, my dear madam. There were two
young ladies in the family,&mdash;charming girls,&mdash;when
they kept their mouths shut. The moment
they opened them to sing,&mdash;a pair of grinning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
idols. I do not exaggerate, Mrs. Merryweather,&mdash;grinning
idols, madam!"</p>

<p>"Really!" said Mrs. Merryweather. "How
distressing!"</p>

<p>"Distressing? My dear lady, it was excruciating!
They opened their mouths&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, <i>dear</i> Colonel Ferrers!" cried Hildegarde.
"They <i>had</i> to open their mouths, surely!
You would not have had them sing with closed
lips?"</p>

<p>"I am aware that they had to open their
mouths, my child, to some extent. They were
not, I conceive, forced to assume the aspect of
the dentist's chair. They opened their mouths,
I say,&mdash;red gulfs, in which every molar could
be counted,&mdash;and they shut their eyes. They
hunched their shoulders, and they wriggled their
bodies. Briefly, such an exhibition that I wondered
their mother did not shut them in the coal-cellar,
or anywhere else where they might escape
being seen. Frightful, I assure you! frightful!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde and Bell exchanged glances; the
Colonel was on his high horse, and riding it hard.</p>

<p>"And what did they sing?" asked Bell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"They <i>squalled</i>, my dear young lady,&mdash;I
refuse to call such performance singing,&mdash;some
Italian macaroni kind of stuff. Macaroni and
soap-suds,&mdash;that was what it made me think
of. When I was a young lad, they made a
song about the Italian opera,&mdash;new, it was
then, and people didn't take to it at first,&mdash;how
did that go, now? Hum, ha! I ought to be
able to remember that."</p>

<p>"Was it 'Meess Nancy,' perhaps, Colonel?"
asked Mrs. Merryweather. "I think I can
recall that for you."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, the very thing! 'Meess Nancy
said unto me'&mdash;if you would be so obliging,
Mrs. Merryweather."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Merryweather sang, to the funniest
little languishing tune:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Meess Nancy said unto me one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Vill you play on my leetle guitar?'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Meess Nancy said unto me one day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Vill you play on my leetle guitar?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Vich goes "tinky-tink-ting!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Vich goes "tanky-tank-tang!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Vich goes "ting,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Vich goes "tang,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Vich goes "ta!"'"</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly!" said the Colonel. "Precisely!
tanky-tank-tang! that is the essence of half
the drawing-room music one hears; and the
other half is apt to be the kind of cacophonous
folderol that my nephew Jack tortures the inoffensive
air with. By the way, Hildegarde,&mdash;hum,
ha! nothing of the sort!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Colonel Ferrers!" said
Hildegarde, somewhat perplexed, as was no
wonder.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the slightest consequence," said
the Colonel, looking slightly confused. "My absent
way, you know. Oblige us with another
song, will you, my dear? 'Mary of Argyle,' if
you have no special preference for anything else.
My mother was fond of 'Mary of Argyle'; used
to sing it when I was a lad,&mdash;hum, ha! several
years ago."</p>

<p>"In one moment, Colonel Ferrers. I just
wanted to ask you, since you spoke of Jack,&mdash;have
you any idea when we shall see the dear
fellow? Is there any chance of his getting
home in time for Christmas?"</p>

<p>But here the Colonel became quite testy. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
vowed that his nephew Jack was the most irresponsible
human being that ever lived, with the
exception of his father. "My brother Raymond&mdash;Jack's
father, you are aware, Mrs. Grahame&mdash;never
knows, it is my belief, whether it is
time to get up or to go to bed. As to eating
his meals&mdash;it is a marvel that the man is alive
to-day. Never sits down at a Christian table
when he is alone. Housekeeper has to follow
him round with plates of victuals, and put them
under his nose wherever he happens to stand
still. Never sits down, my brother Raymond.
Like Shelley the poet in that respect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did Shelley never sit down?" asked Bell,
innocently. "I never heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;hum, ha!&mdash;alluded to the other peculiarity,"
said the Colonel. "Shelley would stand&mdash;or
sit&mdash;for hours, I have been told, with his
dinner under his nose, entirely unconscious of
it. I have never believed the story that he
wrote a sonnet with a stalk of asparagus one
day, taking it for a pen. Was surprised, you
understand, at finding nothing on the paper.
Ha!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colonel Ferrers," said Hildegarde, gravely,
"it is my belief that you made up that story
this very instant."</p>

<p>"Quite possible, my dear," said the Colonel,
cheerfully. "Absence of mind, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or presence!" said the girl, significantly.
"I wonder why we are not to hear about our
Jack."</p>

<p>"Possibly, my love, because I do not intend
to tell you," said the Colonel, with his most
beaming smile. "Did you say you would be so
very obliging as to sing 'Mary of Argyle' for
me?"</p>

<p>And Hildegarde sang.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><i>DIE EDLE MUSICA.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Bell Merryweather</span> was sitting alone in
the parlour at Braeside. She was waiting for
Hildegarde to finish some piece of work up-stairs
before going for a twilight walk. So waiting,
she naturally drifted to the piano, and, opening
it, began to play.</p>

<p>Bell might love her Greek and her botany,
might delight, too, in rowing and riding, and in
all the out-door life that kept her strong, young
body in such perfect condition; but, after all,
these things filled the second and third place
only in her life; her music was first, once and
always. All through school and college she had
kept it up steadily, seeking always the best
instruction, loving always the best music; till
now, at eighteen, she was at once mistress and
faithful servant of her beloved art. Hildegarde
played with taste and feeling, but she never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cared to touch the piano when she might listen
to Bell instead; there was all the difference
in the world, and she knew it far better than
modest Bell herself. So when Hildegarde
now, up-stairs, heard the firm, light touch on
the keys below, she nodded to herself, well
pleased, and went on with her work. "Such
a treat for Mammina!" she said. "And I do
want to finish this, and the dear girl will not
know whether she plays five minutes or an
hour."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was right. Bell played on and
on, one lovely thing after another; and forgot
her friend up-stairs, and her walk, and everything
else in the world, save herself and <i>die
edle Musica</i>.</p>

<p>Now, it happened about this time,&mdash;or it
may have been half an hour after,&mdash;that some
one else stood and listened to the music that
filled the early December twilight with warmth
and beauty and sweetness. A young man had
come running lightly up the steps of the veranda,
with a tread that spoke familiarity, and eagerness,
too; had hastened towards the door, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
paused there, at the sound of the piano. A
young man, not more than twenty at the most,
very tall, with a loose-jointed spring to his gait,
that might have been awkwardness a year or
two ago, but sat not ungracefully on him now.
He had curly brown hair, and bright blue eyes,
set rather far apart under a broad, white forehead;
not a handsome face, but one so honest
and so kindly that people liked to look at it,
and felt more cheerful for doing so.</p>

<p>The blue eyes wore a look of surprise just
now; surprise which rapidly deepened into
amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" he murmured. "That can't be,&mdash;and
yet it must, of course. How on earth
has she learned to play like this?" He listened
again. The notes of Schumann's "<i>Faschingsschwank</i>"
sounded full and clear. The bright
scene of the Vienna carnival rose as in a magic
vision; the flower-hung balconies, the gardens
and fountains, the bands of dancers, like long
garlands, swinging hand in hand through the
white streets. The young man saw it all,
almost as clearly as his bodily eyes had seen it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a year before. And the playing! so sure and
clear and brilliant, so full of fire and tenderness&mdash;</p>

<p>"But she cannot have learned all this in two
years!" said Jack Ferrers. "It's incredible!
She must have worked at nothing else; and she
has never said a word&mdash; Ah! but, my dear girl,
you must have the violin for that!"</p>

<p>The player had struck the opening chords of
the great Mendelssohn Concerto for piano and
violin.</p>

<p>The youth lifted something that he had laid
down on the veranda seat,&mdash;an oblong black
box; lifted it as tenderly as a mother lifts her
sleeping child. Then he stepped quietly into the
twilight hall.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that Bell, who was very
near the gate of heaven already, heard suddenly,
as it seemed to her, the music of angels; a tone
mingling with her own, pure, thrilling, ecstatic;
lifting her on wings of lofty harmony, up, up,&mdash;far
from earth and its uncertain voices, nearer
and ever nearer to where love and light and
music were blended in one calm blessedness. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
never occurred to her to stop; hardly even to
wonder what it meant, or who was doing her
this service of heavenly comradeship. She
played on and on, as she had never played
before; only dreading the end, when the spirit
would leave her, and she must sink to earth
again, alone.</p>

<p>When the end did come, there was silence in
the room. It was nearly dark. Any form that
she should see on turning round would needs be
vague and shadowy, yet she dreaded to turn;
and she found herself saying aloud, unconsciously:</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought I was in heaven!"</p>

<p>"I <i>knew</i> I was!" said Jack Ferrers. "Oh,
Hilda, how have you done it? How was it
possible for you to do it? My dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was stepping forward eagerly; but two
voices cried out suddenly, one in terror, it
seemed, the other,&mdash;was it joy or pain? The
girl at the piano turned round; even in the
dark, Jack knew instantly that it was not his
cousin. He looked helplessly towards the door,
and there stood another shadowy figure; what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
did it all mean? But now, after that pause of
an instant, this second figure came forward with
outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"My dear, dearest old Jack! I have been
listening; I could not speak at first. Oh, welcome,
dear old fellow! Welcome home a hundred
thousand times!"</p>

<p>Ah! now Jack knew where he was. This
was the welcome he had thought of, dreamed
of, all the way home across the ocean. This
was the surprise that he had planned, and carried
out so perfectly. This was Hilda herself,
in flesh and blood; his best friend, better than
any sister could be. These were her kind, tender
eyes, this was her sweet, cordial voice, in
which you felt the heart beating true and steady,&mdash;all
was just as he had pictured it in many a
lonely hour during the past two years. Only,&mdash;only,
who was it he had gone to heaven with just
now? A stranger!</p>

<p>Before his bewildered mind could grasp anything
more, Hildegarde had put out her hand,
and caught the silent shape that was flitting past
her through the doorway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" she cried. "You shall not go! It is
absurd for you two to pretend to be strangers,
after you have been playing together like that;
absurd, and you both know it. Bell, of course
you know this is my cousin Jack, whom I have
so wanted you to meet. Jack, I have written
you of my friend Isabel Merryweather. Oh, oh,
my dears! It was so beautiful! So beautiful!
And I am so happy,&mdash;I really think I am going
to cry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" cried Bell and Jack together;
and the sheer terror in their voices made Hildegarde
laugh instead.</p>

<p>"And you thought it was I!" she cried, still
a little hysterical. "Jack, how could you? I
thought better of you!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't see how it could be," said honest
Jack. "I didn't see how you could possibly have
done it in two years, or,&mdash;or in a lifetime, for
that matter; but how could I suppose,&mdash;how
could I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't, of course. Oh, and to think
of all the delight you are going to give us, the
two of you! Jack, your playing is&mdash;I can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
tell you what it is. My dear, I am afraid to
light the lamp. Shall I see a totally different
Jack from the old one? You have learned such
an infinity, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I should be a most hopeless muff if I hadn't
learned something!" said her cousin. "But you
needn't be afraid to light the lamp, Hilda. You
will see the ostrich, or the giraffe, or the kangaroo,
whichever you prefer. But first I must
thank Miss Merryweather for playing so delightfully.
You have played with the violin before,
of course? I felt that instantly."</p>

<p>There was no reply; for Bell, feeling simply,
desperately, that she must get away, must relieve
the two cousins of her presence, since it
could not by any possibility be welcome, had
seen her moment, and slipped quietly out while
Hildegarde was busy with the lamp.</p>

<p>The light sprang up, and both looked eagerly
round.</p>

<p>"Why, she is gone!" cried Jack. "I say!
And I never thanked her. What an idiot she
must think me!"</p>

<p>"She thought nothing of the sort," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Hildegarde. "She is the most modest, unselfish
creature in the world, and she thought
we would rather be without her. I know
her!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose she was right," yet Hildegarde
fancied a shade of regret in his hearty
tone; "anyhow, she is a brick, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"How would you define a brick?" asked
Hildegarde, demurely.</p>

<p>"A musician," said Jack, emphatically; "and
a&mdash;a good fel&mdash;Oh, well, you know what I
mean, Hilda! And isn't it pretty hard, now,
when a fellow has been away two years, that he
should come back and have the girl of his heart
begin to tease him within five minutes? Oh, I
say, Hilda, how well you're looking! You have
grown prettier; I didn't suppose you could
grow prettier. Would you mind shaking hands
again?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde held out her hand gladly, and
laughed and blushed when her cousin raised it
to his lips in the graceful European fashion.</p>

<p>"You have learned something besides violin-playing,
Jack," she said. "If any one had proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
your kissing hands two years ago, what
would you have done?"</p>

<p>"Taken to the woods," replied Jack, promptly.
"But&mdash;well, they all do it there, of course;
and I saw the <i>gnadige Frau</i>&mdash;Frau J.&mdash;expected
it when I went to dine there, so&mdash;so I
learned. But all the time, Hilda, I thought
I was only learning so that I could kiss your
mother's hand,&mdash;and yours!"</p>

<p>"Dear lad!" said Hilda. "Mamma will be
pleased; she always wishes people would be
'more graceful in their greetings.' Can't you
hear her say it? But why do we stand here,
when she is waiting for us in her room? She
has rheumatism to-day, so I would not let her
come down, poor darling; and here I am keeping
you all to myself, like the highwayman I
am."</p>

<p>"Yes, I always thought you were cut out for
a highwayman," said Jack. "Come along, then!
I have a thousand things to tell you both."</p>

<p>Hand in hand, like happy children, the two
ran up-stairs. Mrs. Grahame was waiting with
open arms. Indeed, she had been the first to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hear the notes of the violin; and her cry&mdash;"Hilda!
Jack is come! our boy is come!"&mdash;had
brought Hildegarde flying from the recesses
of the linen-closet. Her eyes were full
of happy tears; and when Jack bent to kiss
her hand, she folded him warmly in her arms,
and pressed more than one kiss on his broad
forehead.</p>

<p>"My boy!" she said. "My boy has come
back to me! Hilda, it is your brother; do you
understand? It is as if my little son, who went
away so long ago, had been sent back to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother," said Hildegarde, softly. "I
know; we both know, Jack and I. Dear Mother,
blessed one! let the tears come a little; it will
do you good."</p>

<p>They were silent for a little. The two young
people pressed close to the elder woman, who
felt the years surge up around her like a flood;
but there was no bitterness in the waters, only
sweet and sacred depths of love and memory.
The boy and girl, filled with a passionate longing
to cheer and comfort her whom they loved
so dearly, felt perhaps more pain than she did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for they were too young to have seen the smile
on the face of sorrow.</p>

<p>But now Mrs. Grahame was smiling again.</p>

<p>"Dears!" she said. "Dear children! They
are such happy tears, you must not mind them.
And now they are all gone, and that is enough
about me, and too much. Jack, sit down on
that stool; draw it close, so that I can see you
in the firelight. So! And you are there,
Hilda?"</p>

<p>"On the other stool!" said Hildegarde.
"Here we are, love, close beside you."</p>

<p>"That is good! And now, Odysseus, let us
hear! Mr. Ferrers has the floor."</p>

<p>"He certainly has a good deal of it!" said
Jack, looking rather ruefully at his long legs,
which did extend a prodigious distance along
the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>"What do you think of my having grown
two whole inches since I went away? I call it
a shame! Uncle Tom measured me with his
stick before I had been in the house five minutes;
six feet four! It is disgraceful, you
know!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Colonel Ferrers!" cried Hildegarde.
"Isn't he coming soon, to tell us how happy he
is? Why, Jack, do you know, he was so funny
about you last night! I asked when you were
coming, and he quite growled, the dear, and
called you irresponsible, and wouldn't tell us a
thing."</p>

<p>"Of course he wouldn't! Spoil my surprise,
that I had planned so carefully? It is well he
did not! But he told me about it, too,&mdash;about
last night, I mean. He said you would persist
in asking questions, and looking straight at him
as you asked them, so that his only refuge was
in gruffness. Yes, Hilda, he is coming over
after tea,&mdash;I may stay to tea, mayn't I? He&mdash;I
thought they wouldn't mind being alone
for a bit,&mdash;Oh, wait! I haven't come to that
yet. Where shall I begin? Come back to
Leipsic with me, will you?"</p>

<p>Both ladies signified their willingness to take
the voyage at once.</p>

<p>"I have spread the magic carpet!" cried Jack.
"Be seated, if you please! Whisk! Presto!
Behold us in Leipsic. <i>Mesdames</i>, let me have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the honour of presenting you to Herr J,&mdash;&mdash;the
greatest living violinist. Herr Professor, these
are the people I love best in the world, except
two. Well, you see it is very simple, after all.
The Maestro was going on a tour in Russia;
was invited to play before the Czar, and all
kinds of things. He will be gone all winter; so
he said, why should I not come home and see
my father and uncle, and talk over plans with
them? He&mdash;the Maestro&mdash;wants me to work for
the Royal Medal. It's only given out once in three
years, and it's a pretty big thing, but he thinks
I would better try for it. I&mdash;did I write you
about the scholarship I got? No? Well, I
think I did, but it must have been in my last
letter, and Uncle Tom thinks my last letters did
not get posted, or something. Well, yes; I got
a pretty good scholarship, enough to pay my
expenses both ways, and leave me a hundred
dollars besides."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack! how splendid!" cried Hildegarde,
in delight. "That is pretty glorious, I do think.
Wasn't Colonel Ferrers enchanted? Oh! and
when can you see your father? Is he still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in Virginia? Of course you want to fly to
him."</p>

<p>"Not in the least!" replied Jack. "I am
coming to that presently. I think that hundred
dollars rather went to my head. The first thing
I did when I got it was to cable to my father
that I was coming on the <i>Urania</i>. Then I shut
myself up in my room and played a bit, and
then I turned somersaults till my head was like&mdash;like
an apple dumpling; and then I went
shopping."</p>

<p>"Shopping, Jack? I can hardly fancy you
shopping."</p>

<p>"Well, I did! I got a pipe for my father,&mdash;oh,
a beauty!&mdash;meerschaum, of course, carved
with a head of Schumann, the most perfect likeness!
Hilda, when the smoke comes out of it,
you expect to hear it sing the 'Davidsb&uuml;ndler,'
one after another. Of course anybody except
Schumann would have been ridiculous, but it
seems to suit him. Then for Uncle Tom&mdash;a
pipe is horror to him, of course&mdash;I got a walking-stick,
ebony, with no end of a Turk's head
on it. He hates the Turks so, you know. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
knew he would enjoy squeezing it, and rapping
it up against things, and he does like it, I think.
And then&mdash;" the boy began to fumble in his
pockets, blushing with eagerness&mdash;"Mrs. Grahame,
I&mdash;I saw this in a shop, and&mdash;it made
me think of you. Will you put it somewhere,
please, where you will see it now and then, and&mdash;and
think of me?"</p>

<p>The tiny parcel he held out was wrapped in
folds of soft, foreign-looking paper. Mrs. Grahame,
opening it, found an exquisite little copy
of the Nuremburg Madonna, the sweetest and
tenderest figure of motherhood and gracious
womanliness.</p>

<p>"My dear boy!" she said, much moved.
"What a beautiful, beautiful thing! Is it
really mine? How can I thank you
enough?"</p>

<p>"So glad you like it! Is it right, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Hilda; and they nodded
and smiled at each other, while the mother bent
over her treasure, absorbed in its beauty.</p>

<p>"And you, Hilda!" said Jack, searching his
pockets again. "Do you suppose I have anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
for you? Do you really suppose I had time to
stop and think about you?"</p>

<p>The boy was in such a glow of happiness, the
joy so rippled and shone from him, that Hildegarde
could not take her eyes from his face.</p>

<p>"Dear fellow!" she said. "As if I needed
anything but just the sight of you, and the sound
of your&mdash;fiddle! And yet,&mdash;oh, Jack! Jack!
How could you? How could you <i>let</i> yourself
do it?"</p>

<p>Jack had put something into her hands, and
was now leaning back in perfect content, watching
her face in turn, and delighted with every
light that danced over it. The something was
a bracelet; a little, shining garland of stars, each
star a cluster of "aquamarine" stones, clear as
crystal, with the faintest, most delicate shade of
green, hardly seen in the full light. Not a jewel
of great value, but as pretty a thing as ever a
girl saw.</p>

<p>"Jack!" sighed Hilda again. "How could
you? There never was anything so beautiful
in the world; that is confessed."</p>

<p>"And the clasp is the moon, you see!" Jack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
explained, eagerly. "I thought it looked like
the Moonlight Sonata, Hilda, and you used to
like me to play it, you know; and so I thought&mdash;you
do like it? Now I am quite happy! Fate
has nothing better for me than this. Except
one thing!" he added, turning with boyish shyness
from Hilda's warm, almost reproachful
thanks,&mdash;she was hardly reconciled to his spending
his hard-earned money on trinkets for her, yet
she was genuinely delighted with the exquisite
gift, as any right-minded girl would have been.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more!" said Jack. "And
I think I am going to have that now. Hark!
Is not that a step on the veranda? May he&mdash;may
they come up here, dear Mrs. Grahame?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame hesitated a moment, glancing
at her dainty tea-gown, and then around at the
perfection of the pleasant sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" she said, heartily. "If you do
not think Colonel Ferrers will mind,&mdash;such an
old friend, and he knows I am not well to-day."</p>

<p>Jack and Hilda flew down-stairs as fast as
they had flown up; indeed, Hilda was nearly
overthrown by her cousin's impetuous rush.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't told you yet!" he cried. "Hilda,
you guess, don't you? You know what the best
of all is to be? He is here! He&mdash;here he is!"</p>

<p>He threw open the door. Colonel Ferrers's
stalwart form loomed against the pale evening
sky, and behind it was a tall, slender figure,
stooping somewhat, with a shrinking air like
a shy boy.</p>

<p>"Hilda, it is my father!" cried Jack, now at
the top of his heaven, and "Hilda, my dear,
my brother Raymond!" cried the Colonel, not
a whit less pleased. Hilda found her hand taken
between two slender, white hands, that trembled
a little, as they drew her towards the light.</p>

<p>"My boy's best friend!" said Mr. Ferrers;
and Hilda thought that the gentle blue eyes
were even kinder than those fierce gray ones
of the Colonel's, now twinkling with tears, which
he brushed away with furious impatience.</p>

<p>"My boy's kind sister and helper! God bless
you, my dear! I owe you a great debt, which
only love can repay. And now take me to your
mother. I have not seen her for many a long
year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Hildegarde hardly knew how they all got up-stairs,
she was so flurried, so joyfully shaken and
melted and confused. But it was only a moment
before the tall man was bending over her mother's
chair, taking her hands in turn, and gazing at
her wistfully, tenderly.</p>

<p>"Mildred Bond!" said Raymond Ferrers.
"Am I fifty years old, or fifteen, Mildred?
Where are the years gone, my child? You
are utterly unchanged."</p>

<p>But this was more than the Colonel could bear.</p>

<p>"Raymond, you are as great an ass as ever!"
he cried, bringing down his hand with formidable
violence on the slender, stooping shoulder.
"Jack, what did I tell you? I said he was a
mixture of angel and idiot. Look at him!
Hear him! and contradict me if you dare."
And then, as his brother turned and laid an arm
round his shoulder, the Colonel fairly broke down,
and was heard to mutter behind his handkerchief
that the world consisted principally of a parcel
of fools, and that he was the biggest of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mammina!</span>"</p>

<p>"Yes, Hilda!"</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you will not mind my
asking?"</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure! Suppose you try it,
and find out."</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I don't believe you will really mind.
But&mdash;was not Mr. Raymond Ferrers&mdash;very fond
of you, dear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame coloured like a girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, he was. He was&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;very
fond of me, Hilda. It was years and years
ago, of course; he was only a lad. But,&mdash;well,
it happened that we had never met since, you
see; I think we were both a little overcome, for
I, too, was very fond of him, Hilda, though not
in the way he wished. Poor Raymond!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you couldn't care for him, dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"My child! I had seen your father; how
could I think of any one else? But Raymond
did not know that; and&mdash;and it was hard for
him. I trust I did not appear foolish, Hilda?"</p>

<p>She spoke anxiously, and Hilda laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Darling, you appeared like an angel, and
were perfectly calm. I never should have
guessed it from you; but&mdash;he, it was all over
him, at the first glance."</p>

<p>"Poor Raymond!" said Mrs. Grahame again,
meditatively. "And yet he was very happy in
his marriage, I have always heard. His wife
was a lovely person, and sincerely attached to
him. But&mdash;I suppose the seeing me brought
back his boyhood, and some of the old feeling,&mdash;we
are singular creatures, Hilda. Perhaps
you think I might have told you of this before,
Hilda. You see, I never thought of it as anything
belonging to me, dear."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Hilda. "I know! And I
should not have asked if&mdash;if he had not made
it so <i>very</i> obvious. But, oh, how charming,&mdash;how
lovely he is! And how beautiful to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
him with Jack, and the dear Colonel with both
of them! My mother, do you know that we have
the very most delightful friends in the habitable
universe?"</p>

<p>"It really does seem so," said her mother.
"And what a Christmas we shall have, with so
many of them around us! Let me see! Mr.
Merryweather came to-day. Now the whole
Smiling Signal Service, as absurd Gerald calls
it, is here,&mdash;except the good Roger."</p>

<p>Except, indeed! Hildegarde's heart gave a
great bound, and she felt the colour rushing to
cheek and forehead.</p>

<p>"We shall be very glad to see Roger?" said
Mrs. Grahame. "Very glad, daughter dear?"</p>

<p>"Very glad indeed, dearest mother!" said
Hilda. She met her mother's loving glance
bravely, with her own bright smile; here, the
blushing did not matter, for the two hearts,
mother's and daughter's, beat in such true time
together that words were hardly needed to carry
the swift thought from mind to mind.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause; then Mrs. Grahame
went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"And are they not planning all kinds of
merrymaking for Christmas week? Dear me!
Why, it is this very coming week, Hilda! Where
has the month gone?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is to be a great time!" said Hildegarde.
"The flower party, and lots of people
coming down from town for it; and a
toboggan-party,&mdash;if the snow will only come!
and the tree at Roseholme, and I don't know
what else. Do you know, I almost thought the
Colonel and Mr. Merryweather would quarrel
about the tree; both wanted it so much. And
then they both gave up at the same minute,
and each insisted that the other should have
it, till I thought they would quarrel over that.
But it all ended most happily. Hugh, of course!
He came up quietly, and held out two straws;
and they drew, and neither said another word.
Oh, Mother, Hugh is so happy with Jack! I
met them just now; his little face was shining
like a star. Jack was chattering German to
him, and he did not understand a word, but
that made no difference at all. And dear old
Jack! I believe he would have liked to kiss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
every stone in the garden wall&mdash;there! he is
calling me now! I promised to go for a walk
when my work was done. Are you sure you
don't want anything, darling? absolutely sure?
Then good-bye for an hour!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde ran down, and found Jack pacing
the veranda with yard-long strides.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he said, abruptly, "the
first time I came here, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" said Hilda.</p>

<p>"How I fell over a chair, and then knocked
down a hanging-basket? Hilda, I do believe
I should have made away with myself that night,
if there had been any weapons about. I was
simply <i>full</i> of rage and misery; I hated everybody,
myself included; and it did seem to me
as if you might let me alone, and not insist
upon making me talk. I <i>couldn't</i> talk, you
know."</p>

<p>"No, dear, you certainly could not; but you
had to learn. And you are not sorry now,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Sorry! well, rather not! Fancy, if I had
stayed the hateful noodle that I was that night!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Fact is, I was brimful of my own self; that was
the trouble with me. Ah&mdash;who are all these
people Uncle Tom has been telling me about,
next door, in the yellow house? I didn't bargain
for strangers, Hilda!" And my lord
looked slightly injured.</p>

<p>"No, dear!" said Hildegarde. "Of course
we ought to have thought of that, and have
prevented their coming here. We don't own
the house, it is true, but we might have turned
the hose on them, or put rat-poison about, or
kept them off in some way."</p>

<p>"Oh, there you go!" cried Jack. "I say! I
haven't been teased for two years. I forget
what it's like. But seriously, are they really
nice? Do you care for them? I&mdash;I really <i>am</i>
jealous, Hilda; you needn't laugh. I thought
I was going to have you all to myself, and now
here are a lot of people,&mdash;with unreasonable
names, it seems to me,&mdash;and Uncle Tom says
they are your most intimate friends, and that
he loves them all like brothers."</p>

<p>"That was one of them you met last night,"
said Hildegarde, demurely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I say! I was going to ask you,&mdash;was
it, though? of course; I didn't notice her name
much, but I remember now. Well, Hilda, she is
a musician, and of course I'm glad you have had
such a friend as that. I liked her face, too,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You couldn't see her face!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw enough. I saw her eyes just for
a minute, and I know what she's like, anyhow;
didn't I play the Mendelssohn Concerto with her?
So that's all right, and I mean to get her to play
with me a lot, if she will. I like to play with
the piano, only you so seldom find any one&mdash;any
pianist&mdash;who understands the violin; they
are generally thinking about their own playing.
But&mdash;well, what was I saying? It is so jolly
to be talking one's own language again, and
talking to you. I just want to go on and on,
whether I say anything or not."</p>

<p>"So I infer!" said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" cried Jack again. "But&mdash;well,
to go back to these people,&mdash;there are
a lot of them, aren't there? A lot of fellows,
or something?"</p>

<p>"There are!" said Hildegarde, gravely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
"Here are two of them coming now, Jack.
These are the twins, Phil and Gerald; they
are particularly nice fellows, and I want you
to meet them."</p>

<p>"Look here, Hilda! I can't, you know. I'm
going to cut across the field here. I didn't
expect to see anybody this first morning. You
won't mind if I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall mind very much indeed!" said Hildegarde,
with decision. "Jack, you must not be
absurd! You are behaving like a child.</p>

<p>"Oh, good-morning, Phil! Good-morning,
Gerald! I am so glad to see you! This is my
cousin, John Ferrers, who came last night, and
is staying at Roseholme. Jack, these are my
neighbours, Philip and Gerald Merryweather."</p>

<p>The three bowed with mutual distrust.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you!" said Phil, in a tone which
contradicted his words.</p>

<p>"Fine morning!" said Gerald. "You had a
pretty rough passage, I ho&mdash;I'm afraid!"</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Jack, with a detestable little
drawl, which Hildegarde had never heard before.
"I had an excellent passage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The three drew back and looked at each other,
so exactly like strange dogs that the tails only
were wanting, it seemed to Hildegarde. She had
difficulty in keeping her countenance. "What
a comfort," she thought, "if I could only shake
them all, and tell them to behave themselves!"
But outwardly she was calm and smiling, looking
from one scowling face to the other as if all
were wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>"And whither are you bound, boys?" she
asked. "And what frolic is there on hand for
to-day? If the snow would only come! I do
want some tobogganing."</p>

<p>"There is good skating on Jimmy's Pond!"
said Gerald. "We were just coming to see if
you would go this afternoon, Hilda."</p>

<p>At the familiar name, Jack Ferrers glared so
ferociously that Hildegarde almost expected to
hear him bark, and to see him spring at the
other lad's throat. Gerald perceived the impression,
and hastened in pure malice to deepen it.</p>

<p>"I have been counting on a skate with you,
Hilda; you remember the last we had together?
I never shall forget it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Hildegarde had never skated with Gerald
in her life, and she had no idea of putting up
with this kind of thing.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to come!" she said, with
a little ring of steel in her voice that all three
lads knew very well; "if you can find a pair of
skates for my cousin. I know you have a whole
closet full of them. You would like very much
to come, Jack? Very well, then, that is settled!
We will be ready at three o'clock. Good-morning,
boys! Bell and Gertrude will come, too, of
course!"</p>

<p>And with a quick, decided nod she walked on,
Jack following after, after a defiant bow which
was returned with interest.</p>

<p>The cousins walked on in silence for a few
steps; then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't think you really misunderstood what
I said, Hildegarde!" said Jack, coldly. "I did
<i>not</i> say that I should like to go skating. I said
I should be unable to go. Of course it is of no
consequence."</p>

<p>"Of none in the world!" said Hildegarde,
turning upon him with gleaming eyes. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
absurd behaviour of three ridiculous boys,&mdash;Jack!
How could you? I was so mortified,&mdash;so
ashamed of you all! All! But you are
my own; I am responsible for your behaviour.
I never&mdash;" but here she caught a glimpse of
Jack's face, and suddenly burst into a fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was so funny! Jack, none of you
will ever know how funny it was. I am very
angry, but I&mdash;cannot&mdash;help laughing."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are amused!" said Jack Ferrers,
stiffly. "It was worth while to come home
for that."</p>

<p>"Jack! I&mdash;I won't laugh any more&mdash;if I
can help it! Oh, dear! If you had only
seen&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Hildegarde saw that her cousin was really
hurt. Instantly she controlled her laughter, and
laid her hand quietly on his arm.</p>

<p>"Dear lad," she said, "you are not really
angry, any more than I was. Dear Jack, think
about it a little!"</p>

<p>They walked on in silence. Jack was still
smarting under a sense of injury; yet the steady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
friendly hand on his arm seemed to smooth down
his ruffled feelings, whether he would or no.</p>

<p>"You know how it is," he said, presently,
speaking in a more natural voice. "I have been
thinking so long about the home-coming! I
thought it was going to be&mdash;just the same.
I thought I should have you all to myself;
and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack, dear," said Hildegarde, quietly, "are
you thinking of falling in love with me, by any
chance?"</p>

<p>Jack looked down at her with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no! I wasn't, Hilda; but I will, if
you want me to. I&mdash;what makes you say that?
I thought we were brother and sister."</p>

<p>"I thought so, too," said Hildegarde, smiling.
"But if my brother is going to show his teeth
and growl at all the other dogs&mdash;I mean boys&mdash;he
meets, I don't think I shall find it comfortable.
There was a dog in a manger once;
perhaps you have heard of him."</p>

<p>Jack winced, but owned he had.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and even if you were not my
brother," Hildegarde went on, "the idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
being jealous of the twins is so funny that&mdash;well,
when you know them, Jack, you will
laugh as much as I did. They are not that
<i>kind</i> of boy, at all. No boys were ever less
so."</p>

<p>"That red-haired fellow," said Jack, still distrustful;
"what was he saying about skating
with you before? I thought he <i>sounded</i> decidedly
spoony, Hilda. I won't be disagreeable
any more, but I say this seriously."</p>

<p>"Gerald! naughty, naughty Gerald! that was
so like him! He is quick as a flash, Jack, and
he said that just to torment you. I have never
skated with him in my life; I never knew them
till this last summer. Oh, he is such a funny
boy! Come on, and I will tell you some of his
pranks as we go along!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Gerald and Philip Merryweather walked home
in moody silence. They came upon a loose
stone, and kicked it along before them with
savage and purposeful kicks. Neither mentioned
the fact of the stone's representing any
particular person, but when either made a specially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
successful kick, he looked at the other
for sympathy, and found it in a grim nod and
chuckle. Only once did they break silence.</p>

<p>"Poor Codger!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"H'm!" growled Philip, assenting.</p>

<p>"Know when he's coming?"</p>

<p>"No! Don't suppose it will make any difference,
though."</p>

<p>"S'pose not!"</p>

<p>"H'm!"</p>

<p>"H'm!"</p>

<p>Reaching the house, they sat down on the
steps and pitched gravel stones in gloomy rivalry.
So sitting, it chanced that Bell came upon them;
Bell, with a face more than commonly bright
(though she was always one of the most cheerful
of mortals), with her hands full of ground
pine, fresh from a walk in the woods, humming
a fragment of the Mendelssohn Concerto.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with my boys?" she
demanded, promptly.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" responded the twins, with alacrity.
And they lowered like toppling thunderclouds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then tell me all about it!" said Sister Bell,
sitting down on the step, and taking a hand of
each.</p>

<p>"What happened to my twinnies? Did some
one throw away their tadpoles, or did the dog
eat their molasses candy?"</p>

<p>This allusion to early misfortunes could generally
bring a smile, but this time it failed, and
Bell looked from one to the other in genuine
concern.</p>

<p>"Phil! Jerry! What is it?" she asked
again. "Oh, there has been no bad news,
boys? Roger!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gerald groaned.</p>

<p>"Roger!" he said. "That's just it, Bell!
No, nothing of the kind you mean. He's well,
poor dear old Codger. Better than he will be,
when he hears what is going on."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> going on? Come, boys, I really
must know."</p>

<p>"We met Hilda just now," said Gerald.
"Her cousin's come; kind of fiddler-chap from
Germany. I'm afraid it's all up with the
Codger, Bell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Bell, quietly. "And what
makes you think that, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we met them just now! He&mdash;he's
about nine feet tall, to begin with."</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> a beginning! Where does he expect
to end? But I have seen Mr. Ferrers, Jerry.
I saw him last night."</p>

<p>"You did? Why didn't you tell a fellow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I&mdash;hardly know!" said downright
Bell, unused to even the whitest fib. She really
could not, perhaps, have put into words the feeling
that had kept her silent about the scene of
the night before.</p>

<p>"But that is no matter!" she went on.
"What else is the matter with him, besides
height? He can't help that, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he can. But he can help
making up to Hilda, Bell, and he'd better!"
savagely. "Only it's too late now, I suppose!"
despondently. "Why on earth the fellow
couldn't stay and fiddle over there, where
he's wanted,&mdash;don't admire their taste, by the
way!&mdash;instead of coming over here to spoil
everything, is more than <i>I</i> know!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horrid shame!" murmured Phil, taking
careful aim with a pebble at an innocent cat
that was crossing the lawn.</p>

<p>Bell struck his hand up.</p>

<p>"I won't have the cats teased, Phil! And as
for all this nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense!" cried both boys, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I tell you we met them just now," Gerald
went on, "and when he saw us, he looked black
as thunder, and had hardly manners to speak to
us. Perfectly odious; wasn't he, Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely!" echoed Phil.</p>

<p>"And you were very cordial to him, of
course?" said Bell. "You let him see that
you were glad to meet him, and that as Hilda's
warm friends you were anxious to welcome her
cousin cordially, and to show him all the courtesy
you could?"</p>

<p>The twins looked at each other. Bell had an
extraordinary way of putting things sometimes.</p>

<p>"We didn't do anything of the sort!" said
Phil, with an attempt at bluster.</p>

<p>"Because if you did not," his sister went on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
"I am afraid you must have seemed very rude,
my children. Rude and silly!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call names, Tintinnabula!" said
Gerald, turning red.</p>

<p>"Sorry to be obliged to," retorted his sister,
in perfect good humour. "But if you looked at
Mr. Ferrers as you are looking now, there really
can be no doubt about the matter. Now listen,
boys! I know&mdash;Hilda has told me&mdash;a great
deal about this Mr. Jack Ferrers. Hilda loves
him dearly, as dearly as if he were her own
brother, and in exactly the same way. You
need not shake your heads and try to look wise,
my dears, because you are <i>not</i> wise! You are
two very foolish boys, who are trying to run
your heads against a stone wall when there is
no wall there. That is the state of the case
about Mr. Ferrers. I know Hildegarde pretty
well, and I am sure of what I am saying. You
need have no fear of him. As for Roger,&mdash;well,
I don't think you need have any fear for Roger
either."</p>

<p>"Has he&mdash;has she&mdash;do you think they
are&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Bell, putting a hand over the
mouth of each. "I don't think anything! At
least&mdash;well, that isn't true, of course; but it
does no good to talk about these things, dear boys.
I do not think Hilda and Roger are&mdash;are engaged."
Bell dropped her voice to a whisper.
"But I feel quite sure they will be some day,
when the time comes. I think they understand
each other very well. Roger will be here
soon; suppose you leave it all to him, Phil and
Jerry, and don't worry about it. But there is one
thing you can do, and it should be done soon."</p>

<p>"What?" cried both boys, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Put on your good clothes, and your good
manners, and go to call at Roseholme."</p>

<p>"We'll be shot if we will!" cried the twins.</p>

<p>"Be just as nice as you know how to be to
Mr. Jack Ferrers. He&mdash;he is a remarkable
person, I have reason to think. You see," she
spoke rather hastily, "Hilda has told me so
much about him. And I&mdash;well, I heard him
play last night, and he is a very wonderful performer,
boys. You never, in your little lives,
heard anything like his playing. He is too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
much in love with his art to think of any such
nonsense as has been troubling your silly heads;
you will understand that, the moment you hear
him."</p>

<p>Gerald made a feeble protest to the effect that
he hated fiddling, but there was little hope in
his tone. And he was promptly reminded of
his having spent his last fifty cents the winter
before on a ticket for Sarasate's concert, and
saying that it was the best investment he ever
made.</p>

<p>The boys knew that their cause was lost; and
when Bell added, as a clincher, "Ask Mammy,
and see what she says," they retired from the
unequal contest.</p>

<p>"Oh, we know what Mammy will say!
Don't hit us when we are down, Bell. We'll
go, and make asses of ourselves as well as we
know how."</p>

<p>"Oh, not that, dears, I entreat!" cried Bell;
and then ran swiftly into the house, laughing.</p>

<p>The twins resumed their occupation of pitching
gravel stones, but a change had come over
their spirits. Phil was actually whistling, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Gerald hummed a bass with perfect cheerfulness.
The cat came back across the lawn, and
they threw stones before her nose and behind
her tail, avoiding contact with her person (for
she was a beloved cat, in hours of joy), and contenting
themselves with seeing her skip hither
and thither in uninjured surprise.</p>

<p>"Philly!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jerry!"</p>

<p>"Us feels a lot better, don't us, Philly?"</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Phil, and the sound was now
one of content and peace.</p>

<p>"She's not a bad sort, the Tintinnabula!"
Gerald went on, meditatively. "She doesn't
harry a fellow, as some fellows' sisters do. She
pokes you up and smooths you down at the same
time, somehow. That's the way a girl ought
to be&mdash;my opinion. Come along, Ferguson, and
let's do something to celebrate!"</p>

<p>"All right!" said Phil. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any old thing! Come along!"</p>

<p>And they went and wrestled in the conservatory,
and broke three flower-pots, and had a
delightful morning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>JIMMY'S POND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> it came to pass that, as Jack Ferrers was
strolling about the garden with Hugh after dinner,
talking about old times, and pausing at
every other step to greet some favourite shrub
or stick or stone,&mdash;it came to pass that he heard
steps at the gate, and, turning, saw the Messrs.
Merryweather, holding themselves very straight,
and looking very sheepish. They had compromised
with Bell on skating dress, instead of the
detested "good clothes," and Gerald carried several
pairs of skates in his hand. They fumbled
with the latch a moment, during which Jack felt
extremely young, and was conscious of redness
creeping up to his ears. But then, they were
quite as red, he reflected; and, after all, as
Hilda said, he was two years older than these
boys, and if they really were all she made them
out to be&mdash;why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>So it was a very different-looking Jack who
advanced to meet the embarrassed boys at the
gate. It was perhaps the first time in his young
life that Gerald had been embarrassed, and he
found the sensation unpleasant.</p>

<p>Before any of them could speak, however, a
joyous whoop was heard from another quarter.
Hugh had been investigating an old nest, and
had just caught sight of the friends from Pumpkin
House. He came running now, his face
alight with welcome.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jerry! How do you do? How <i>do</i> you
do, Phil? I am very well, thank you! Do you
know my Jack? Because he has come home;
and he is almost the dearest person in the world.
And he has grown up his own beanstalk, he
says, and that is what makes him so tall. And
he has brought me the most beautiful soldiers
that ever were, and we are going to have battles,
even the prancings, the prancings of their
mighty ones! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah it is!" said Jack. "How d'ye
do?" And he held out his hand cordially
enough. "Awfully good of you to bring the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
skates! Come in, won't you, and see my father
and my uncle?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know whether you liked Acmes or
Clubs," said Gerald, "so I brought both. Clubs
are the best, we all think."</p>

<p>"So do I! These are just right, I think.
Awfully good of you, I'm sure! You ought to
see the things they wear in Germany; like the
old ones Uncle Tom has hanging up in that
trophy in the hall."</p>

<p>Chatting cheerfully, they moved on towards
the house, taking note of one another as they
went. Jack found the tones of the boys' voices
very clear and good, free from any nasal quality;
Phil and Gerald decided that there must be
a good deal of muscle in those long, lean arms,
and that it would not be so easy to "lick" the
stranger as they had thought on first seeing
him.</p>

<p>On Phil's remarking that his sisters and the
"kids" had gone across the fields to the pond,
there to await the rest of the party, Jack said
he would be ready in three minutes, and ushered
them into the library, where the two reunited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
brothers were peacefully smoking together. The
Colonel received the boys most cordially, and,
while Jack hurried away to put on jersey and
knickerbockers, presented them to "My brother
Raymond. Jack's father, young gentlemen!
I trust you and my nephew Jack will be friends.
The young should be friendly,&mdash;eh, Raymond?
My brother Raymond, boys, is a man of genius.
He is probably studying the lines of a fiddle
at this moment,&mdash;an imaginary fiddle, you
understand,&mdash;and I doubt if he is aware of
your presence, or of one word I have been
saying."</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, Tom!" said Mr.
Ferrers, holding out his hand to the boys,
with the peculiarly sweet smile that won all
hearts to him at the first glance, "not quite
so bad as that. I am delighted to see you,
young gentlemen. I have already heard a good
deal about your cheerful circle here. I am, it is
true, somewhat absent-minded,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Absent-minded! Jupiter Capitolinus! When
it comes to a man putting sugar and cream on
his mutton-chop at breakfast,&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know that I do not prefer it
so, Tom? We have many curious customs in
Virginia, you know. It wasn't bad, really!"</p>

<p>"Not bad!" snorted the Colonel. "Five-year-old
mutton, hung a fortnight, and broiled
by Elizabeth Beadle; and this man treats it as
a pudding, and then says it was not bad! Elizabeth
Beadle wept when Giuseppe told her about
it; shed tears, sir! Said there was no pleasure
in feeding you."</p>

<p>"Poor Elizabeth!" said Raymond Ferrers,
laughing. "Dear, good soul! I must go and
ask her to make me some molasses cookies with
scalloped edges. Will that pacify her, Tom?
Where is the boy?"</p>

<p>"Raymond, do not try me further than I can
bear!" said his brother, with marked ferocity.
"Ask for the boy every five minutes, my dear
brother! a shorter interval than that is beyond
my powers of endurance, which have their
limits. The boy, sir, if you persist in applying
that epithet to a young giraffe who has already
scraped more paint off my lintels than I can
supply in six months,&mdash;well, I will make it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
three, if you specially desire it,&mdash;is putting on
his togs, to go skating with these young fellows.
And what is more, Raymond, I know two old
fellows who are going to be asses enough to put
on <i>their</i> togs and go skating with the youngsters.
Come along, sir! Jimmy's Pond, Ray! Come
along!"</p>

<span class="caption">ON JIMMY&#39;S POND.</span>
</div>

<p>A pleasant sight was Jimmy's Pond an hour
later, when all the party had assembled. Hildegarde
came in regal state, escorted by Colonel
Ferrers and his brother, one walking on either
side, while the three tall lads strode along before,
now thoroughly at ease with each other,
and Hugh capered and curveted in the rear.
The child had a horse's tail fastened to his belt
behind, and was Pegasus on Helicon, oblivious
of all things earthly.</p>

<p>They found Bell and Gertrude awaiting them,
their cheeks already glowing from a preliminary
tour of the pond. In the distance Willy and
Kitty could be seen tugging each other valiantly
along, falling and scrambling down and up.
Bell was looking her best, in her trim suit of
brown velveteen, with the pretty little mink cap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Hildegarde thought her more like a snow-apple
than ever, and hoped Jack saw how pretty and
sweet she was. Air-castles are pleasant building,
and our Hildegarde had one well under way
already; a castle whose walls should rise to the
sound of music, and in which two happy people
should play, play, play, all day and every day.</p>

<p>Hildegarde herself, in dark blue corduroy
trimmed with chinchilla, was very good to look
at, and more than one pair of eyes followed her
as she swept along in graceful curves, holding
Hugh's hands in hers.</p>

<p>"A very lovely young creature, Tom!" said
Raymond Ferrers, as he stood a while, after
fastening his skates. "Not so beautiful as her
mother. I find Mildred more beautiful than
ever, Tom."</p>

<p>"You were always near-sighted, Raymond,
you will allow me to observe!" cried the Colonel,
ruffling instantly. "I admire Mrs. Grahame
beyond any woman&mdash;of her age&mdash;that lives.
She is a noble woman, sir! an admirable creature!
But to say that she compares in looks
with a blooming creature like that,&mdash;a princess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
by Jove! A young Diana, the very sight of
whom makes a man young again. By the way,
Raymond," he added, after a pause, in an altered
voice. "I don't know, my dear fellow, whether
you have noticed any&mdash;a&mdash;resemblance, any
look of&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, my dear Tom; I noticed it
instantly. Sweet Hester! This might be her
younger sister. Yes! yes! <i>Tempo passato</i>, eh,
brother? We are old fellows, but we once were
young."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" cried the Colonel,
throwing off his mood with sudden violence.
"Speak for yourself, sir! If a man chooses
to spend his days hunched over a table, making
fiddles, I don't say how things may turn out
with him; but for myself,&mdash;here, Young Sir!
bring me a hockey-stick, will you?"</p>

<p>Hugh, prancing by in full career, paused, and
surveyed his guardian with dreamy eyes.</p>

<p>"Hi-hi-hi!" he replied, with a creditable
attempt at a whinny.</p>

<p>The Colonel stiffened to "attention."</p>

<p>"What did I understand you to remark, sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
he inquired. "I experience a difficulty in following
your interesting observation."</p>

<p>"Hi-hi-hi!" repeated the boy. "I am Pegasus;
I do not understand your language. I will find
Bellerophon, and send him to you."</p>

<p>He retired a few paces, and gravely removed
his tail, then came back, beaming with cheerfulness,
every inch a boy.</p>

<p>"What was it you wanted, Guardian?" he
cried. "I was a horse then, you see, so I really
couldn't; please excuse me!"</p>

<p>"I wanted a hockey-stick, sir!" said the Colonel,
with some severity. "And it is my opinion
that two-legged horses would better keep their
wits about them.</p>

<p>"A game of hockey, Raymond," here he turned
to his brother, "will warm your blood, and
bring back your wits. 'Polo,' they call it nowadays;
parcel of fools! It's my belief that
nine-tenths of the human race to-day don't
know what they are talking about. Don't understand
their own language, sir! Polo, indeed!
Ha! here are the sticks. Now we shall see about
this 'old fellow' business!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, it was a marvellous thing to see the
agility of the Colonel in his favourite sport. He
swept here and there, he made the most astonishing
hits, he hooked the ball from under the
very noses of the amazed and delighted boys.
Raymond Ferrers, too, after watching the sport
for a few minutes, yielded to the spirit of the
hour, and was soon cutting away with the best
of them.</p>

<p>A pleasant sight was Jimmy's Pond, indeed!
The pond itself was a thing of beauty, a disk of
crystal dropped down in a hollow of dark woods;
dropped into the middle of this again, a tiny
islet, with a group of slender firs, lovely to
behold. And dotted here and there on the
shining gray-silver of the ice, these happy players,
young and old, darted hither and thither,
filled with the joy of the hour and the pleasure
of each other's presence.</p>

<p>It might have been interesting, could one
have stood invisible on the bank, to hear the
fragments of talk, as the different groups swept
by in the chase. They seemed to drop naturally
into couples, without any special prearrangement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
First came the two brothers, intent on
the ball, bent on keeping it ahead of them, and
unconscious of anything else.</p>

<p>"Now, sir!" the Colonel would cry. "Let
me see you beat that! Hi! There she&mdash;no!
she doesn't! Ha! ha! Beat you that time, sir!</p>

<p>
"'Poor old Raymound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fell into a hay-mound!'</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Do you remember that, sir? Only rhyme I
ever made in my life; proud as a peacock I was
of it, sir! And what was the scurrilous verse
you made about me?"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Tommy, Tommy Tantrum,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Crowing like a bantrum!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said his brother, laughing.</div>

<p>"I always call them 'bantrums,' always shall.
Aha! Where are you now, boy? Off she goes!"</p>

<p>Next came Gertrude and Phil, swinging easily
along together.</p>

<p>"So glad he is really nice, because he looks
so, and it would be so horrid if he were horrid,
wouldn't it, Phil? And Bell says he plays&mdash;oh,
wonderfully, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Playing isn't everything in the world, Toots!
But he does seem to be a good fellow enough.
Told us a lot, coming over here, about the way
he lived over in Germany. I say! I'd like to
go there! Two or three duels every day; great
sport, it must be!"</p>

<p>Now it was Willy and Kitty, skating away
sturdily, with short, energetic strokes, and holding
each other up bravely.</p>

<p>"So he asked me if I would swap with him
for another hard one, and I said yes, if it was
hard enough; for this Mexican one, you see,
was very hard indeed. He said it was.</p>

<p>"So I said all right, hand it over. Well,
it was just the end of recess, and he handed it
over, all scrumpled up, in a kind of hurry, and
I crammed it into my pocket without looking.
And when I came to look at it after school, it
was a mean old three-cent 'Norji.' So I
knocked him down, and it just happened that
one of his old teeth was loose, and it came out.
I was glad of it, and so were all the fellows, for
he meant to cheat, you see; that's why I had
the black marks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Now come Jack and Bell, she a little out of
breath, being unused to skating with a giraffe;
he all unconscious, discoursing high themes.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good many people play it short, with
a kind of choppiness. I hate to hear a violin
chop. But J&mdash;&mdash; gives it with a long, smooth
crescendo that seems to carry you straight out
of the room, you know, out into the open air,
and up among tree-tops. Do you ever feel that
way? You seem to feel the air blowing all
about you, and&mdash;hear all the voices that are
shut up in the trees and flowers, and can't get out
generally. You know what I mean, I am sure!"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Bell, softly. "But they are all
answering to the violin, don't you think? They
would not speak to the piano in that way."</p>

<p>"Depends upon who plays it," says gallant
Jack. And Hildegarde, close behind, hears, and
stumbles a little, and catches Gerald's hand,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Take them both!" says Gerald. "Take, incidentally,
my heart with them; unless its size
and its lacerated condition would make the burden
unwelcome, Hilda?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I doubt if I should notice," says Hildegarde.
"Yes, I will take both hands, Jerry; let us try
the outer edge, now. There! that is a delightful
swing! You do skate very well, my child."</p>

<p>"Ah! you should see Roger skate!" cried
loyal Gerald; and is rewarded by seeing a very
pretty blush deepen in his companion's bright
cheek.</p>

<p>"Good old Codger! I wish he were here,
skating with you, Hilda!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" says Hilda. "I am sorry to
incommode you, Gerald. I can skate perfectly
well alone, thank you. There! Don't be absurd,
Jerry! You'll get out of step if you don't take
care. Do you think we could do a figure of
eight together? Let's try!"</p>

<p>Last of all, alone, yet in a world peopled with
fantastic joys, came little Hugh. He had his
tail on again, and he was skating with a high-stepping
gait, rather more suggestive of trotting
than was compatible with safety. He murmured
to himself as he went, and his talk was
far from hockey or any delights of skating.</p>

<p>"Yonder, dear Bellerophon! look yonder, far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
down below this fleecy cloud that I am just going
to plunge into! Now wait till I get through
it, and you will see. The cloud is all full of
monsters, whales, and crocodiles, and&mdash;hairy
mammoths; and we have to plunge through
them, and they claw after us and try to catch
us. But I switch my tail, dear Bellerophon"
(here he switched the tail vigorously), "and that
frightens them, so that they crawl back into
their holes, the ugly things. But down on the
earth there, do you see three little spires of
smoke, right by the mouth of that black hole?
That is the Chim&aelig;ra, Bellerophon! We have
come all the way, and now we are going to
have the most terrible fight that any one ever
had,&mdash;Samson or Hercules or any one else. Aha!
now is the time, you see, for me to say 'Aha'
among the trumpets; that is why I made you
bring your trumpet along. My neck is clothed
with thunder, and I am pawing in the valley.
See me paw!"</p>

<p>Alas, for the winged steed! Pawing in the
valley is a dangerous pastime on smooth ice,
and unsustained by hind legs. Pegasus, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
head high in air, looking forward to battle and
glory, paid little attention to things at his feet.
His skate caught in a crack, and, checked in
full speed, he came heavily to the ground, and
lay motionless.</p>

<p>Hildegarde and Gerald heard the crash, and
were at his side in a moment, raising him. The
little fellow was stunned, and there was an ugly
cut on his forehead.</p>

<p>"Hugh, dear!" cried Hildegarde. "Is it
very bad, little boy? You are all right now;
Jerry and I are here, and you will be feeling
better in a moment."</p>

<p>She took the child's head in her lap, and
stanched the blood with her handkerchief, rubbing
his temples gently, while Gerald chafed his
hands. Presently Hugh opened his eyes. At
first his look was vacant, but soon the light
came back into the blue eyes, and he tried to
smile.</p>

<p>"I pawed too hard!" he whispered. "Beloved,
it wasn't the right valley to paw in."</p>

<p>Hildegarde and Gerald exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"He's a little out!" murmured Gerald. "We'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
better get him home as quick as we can. Phil
and I will carry him."</p>

<p>By this time the others, looking back, had
seen that something was wrong, and came hurrying
back. Colonel Ferrers turned very white
when he saw Hugh lying motionless, his head
pillowed on Hildegarde's lap, and the red stain
on his temple.</p>

<p>"My little boy!" he gasped. "Jack, where
are you? The child! The child is hurt!" Jack
was already bending over Hugh; indeed, the
anxious group pressed so close that Hildegarde
motioned them to back.</p>

<p>"I don't think he is much hurt," she said,
looking up at the Colonel, and speaking as
cheerfully as she could. "He spoke to me just
now, Colonel Ferrers. He was stunned by the
fall. I don't think the cut amounts to anything,
really."</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, who had been examining
the cut, "this isn't anything, Uncle Tom.
It's the shock that is the trouble, and he'll be
over that in a minute. You're better already,
aren't you, old chap?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh opened his eyes again, but slowly, as
if it were an effort.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he said, politely. "Yes,
I am better, thank you, but not quite well yet.
You did not seem to understand what I said, so
I thought I would wait till I could speak better."</p>

<p>Seeing Jack look bewildered, Gerald whispered,
"He was talking nonsense. He takes you
for me now; it was to me he was talking."</p>

<p>"I was not talking nonsense!" said Hugh,
clearly. "I said I had been pawing in the
valley, and that this was not the right valley
to paw in. It wasn't! My Beloved will understand
what I mean, if she uses her mind."</p>

<p>"He was a horse!" cried the Colonel. "Astonishing
thing, that nobody can understand that
child, when he is speaking perfectly rationally.
He was a horse, I tell you! Whinnied at me,
sir, when I asked him to get me a hockey-stick.
Try it again, Boy! Let's hear you once more,
eh?"</p>

<p>Hugh smiled, but could not do more than
shake his head.</p>

<p>"Thank you for explaining, Guardian!" he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
said. "I was Pegasus, you see, and Bellerophon
and I were just going to plunge down through
the clouds and kill the Chim&aelig;ra; but I forgot
where I was for a minute, and began to paw in
the valley, and say 'Aha!' and, of course, the
cloud broke through, and down we went. I hope
dear Bellerophon isn't hurt."</p>

<p>"Bellerophon is all right!" said Jack. "Right
as a trivet. He says he thinks you'd better go
home, old man; he thinks it will be better Chim&aelig;ra-hunting
to-morrow, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" cried the Colonel, making a
brave effort to enter into the child's idea.</p>

<p>"Go back to the stable, Boy,&mdash;I mean Dobbin,
or whatever your name is, and&mdash;and have some
hay!"</p>

<p>But Hugh's brow contracted.</p>

<p>"Pegasus didn't eat hay!" he murmured, still
leaning against Hildegarde's shoulder.</p>

<p>"No, dear," said the girl. "The Colonel did
not mean hay; he meant asphodels and amaranth
and moly."</p>

<p>"That sounds better," said Hugh.</p>

<p>"I say," whispered Gerald, who was beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to recover from his alarm, "you know, I
suppose, that asphodel is a kind of pigweed?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Yes! There is no need of the child's
knowing it yet. How shall we get him home,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"But I will walk home!" cried Hugh, hearing
the last words. "I will perhaps trot home,
only slowly."</p>

<p>He tried to rise, but sank back again.</p>

<p>"It appears as if there were wheels in my
head," he murmured. "They go round too
fast."</p>

<p>"Of course they do," said Jack, in the most
matter-of-fact way. "I'm going to harness myself
into them, and take you home that way.
Put him up on my back, will you, Merryweather?
So! there we are!"</p>

<p>Delighted to find himself in the once familiar
position, Hugh looked up to smile at the anxious
Colonel, who stood wiping his brow, and wishing
for once that he were twenty and a giraffe.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now, Guardian!" he said.
"All right, Beloved! My Jack is an ostrich
again, and I am not Pegasus any more just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
now. I am only Hugh. Good-bye! Good
hunting!"</p>

<p>"Only Hugh!" repeated Colonel Ferrers, gazing
after the two, as they went across the field,
Jack walking steadily, with long, even steps,
very different from his usual hop-skip-and-jump
method of progression.</p>

<p>"Only Hugh! Only the greater part of the
world&mdash;eh? what are you saying, Hilda, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Only that we will go home together, dear
Colonel Ferrers!" said Hildegarde, who had
already taken off her skates. "We will go back
together, and the others can follow whenever
they are ready. We shall find him comfortable
already, with Mrs. Beadle tucking him up in
bed, and talking about chicken broth and wine
jelly, neither of which he will need in the least.
Come, dear sir!"</p>

<p>"I will come!" said the Colonel. "You are
a good child, Hilda! I&mdash;I am rather shaken,
I believe. I will come with pleasure, my love!
Be good enough to take my arm!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>MERRY CHRISTMAS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hildegarde</span> awoke in the dark, with the
sound of bells in the air. Her first thought
was that of all women in similar case&mdash;fire!
She sat up in bed and listened; but these were
no fire-bells that rang so joyously, breaking
through the hush of the winter morning with
glad rejoicing. "Glory to the newly born!"
she said, softly, and was silent for a little. Presently
she waved her hand in a comprehensive
greeting to the friends on walls and shelves,
whom she could not yet see.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas!" she cried. "Merry
Christmas, Sir Walter! Merry Christmas, Viscount,
and you too, Saint William! What a
pity I cannot say it in Dutch!"</p>

<p>She hummed a carol to herself, as she recalled
the night before, Christmas Eve, which she had
spent with the Merryweathers. They had gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
together to the carol service at the little church,
which they had all helped to make beautiful
with spruce and fir and hemlock. After that
they sang hymns and carols at home, in full
chorus, with such hearty good-will and earnest
feeling as it was a joy to remember; and then
came the hanging of the stockings. An only
child for so long, Hildegarde had never seen
before the bewildering, enchanting bustle of
Christmas Eve in a large family; the hanging
of the stockings, six in a row, the whole length
of the great fireplace in the nursery; the delightful
mysteries, the parcels which no one
saw, the whisperings which no one heard save
those to whom they were addressed, the tiptoeing
hither and thither, the rustle of tissue-paper,&mdash;ah!
it was all very pleasant! The kind
friends had begged her to stay with them, and
share the morning fun, which they declared to
be the best of all; but that Hildegarde could
not do.</p>

<p>"Mamma and I have only each other!" she
said. "You would not really have me leave
her alone, dear people!" and the Merryweathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
were obliged to confess that they would not,
upon any account. So they had parted, with
many plans and promises for the next day,&mdash;the
great, the blessed day of the year. And
now it was here! and oh, was it&mdash;could it
really be snowing?</p>

<p>Hildegarde listened, and heard a sound as
of fairy hands beating softly on the window-panes.
It was growing lighter every moment,
but the light came through a soft, white dimness.
Hildegarde ran to the window; the
ground was white, the dark branches of the
evergreens were bending under a weight of
snow, and it was snowing still, not furiously,
but in a quiet, determined way, that meant
business. Oh, joy! At last, the longed-for
winter had come! This ungrateful girl had
already received many favours from the Frost
King; she had skated, she had had icicles to eat,
she had broken through the ice, and got a good
wetting,&mdash;still she was not content, but longed
for snow; and now she had her heart's desire.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And we'll all go tobogganing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bog, bog, bogganing!"</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>she sang, as she dressed herself, stopping now
and then to dance about the room a little when
she felt cold; for the morning was evidently
sharp, and the cold had got into the house in
good earnest.</div>

<p>Running down-stairs, she found the breakfast-room
warm and bright with a crackling, leaping
fire on the hearth. Mrs. Grahame was already
down, and her long, silent embrace was the
first and best Christmas greeting. Then it was
"Merry Christmas!" and again "Merry Christmas!"
as Auntie came into the room, bringing
the fragrant coffee, and the tray piled high with
good things.</p>

<p>"Oh, and the mail has come!" cried Hildegarde,
fairly dancing round the table to her
place. "See, my love! Letters from everybody,
heaps upon heaps! Oh, what joy!"</p>

<p>There were greetings from all the distant
friends, it seemed; from all the good people at
Bywood, from Rose and Doctor Flower, from
the dear old couple at Hartley's Glen.</p>

<p>"Oh, how good every one is!" cried Hildegarde.
"And here is a parcel&mdash;Mammina,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
what can this be? It looks like Aunt Emily's
hand."</p>

<p>"It seems a desperate measure to propose,"
said Mrs. Grahame, "but I <i>have</i> heard of parcels
being opened in such a case. I should not wish
to influence you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" cried the girl, who had been
acting on the suggestion, and undoing the box
tied carefully with floss silk. "My Respected
Parent, will you look at this?"</p>

<p>It was the prettiest watch, surely, that ever
was seen, set with blue enamel and pearls; and
with it came a stately little note, assuring "my
grandniece" that this was a slight return indeed
for the pleasure that she had given to her affectionate
E. D.</p>

<p>"Poor dear Aunt Emily!" cried Hildegarde.
"She has so little pleasure, I suppose every little
attention counts for a good deal. Oh, aren't
you glad we sent her the Mechlin tabs? She
and Hobson will have good times over them, I
am sure. Well, Auntie, what now?"</p>

<p>Auntie brought in a huge box. "Dis ain't
for you, Miss Hildy, chile, dis for you' Ma.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
You can' 'spec' to have everyt'ing, young
lady!"</p>

<p>"Flowers, Mammina! Oh, the lovely things!
Do let me see&mdash;From Mr. Raymond Ferrers!
The dear thing! Why, we shall be a perfect
bower, for I know the Colonel is going to send
you a box. Dear me! What a delightful time
we are having, aren't we, love?"</p>

<p>"If you don't eat your breakfast, Hilda, I
shall have all these things taken away, and
kept till dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will eat, I will indeed! See me!
Observe me sacrificing myself to rolls and
orange marmalade! But do you see that it is
snowing, my own? And do you know what
that means? Tobogganing this afternoon, if
there is any faith in Merryweathers."</p>

<p>Hildegarde was so excited it was really difficult
for her to eat anything like enough to satisfy
the demands of Auntie.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to no chu'ch on no empty
stomick!" that potentate announced; and she
actually stood over Hildegarde till a fair portion
of her good things was disposed of. Then, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
church-time came, she must see personally that
both her "Missies" were properly wrapped, and
properly toasted before going out.</p>

<p>"You ain't no right to go out at all, Mis' Grahame,
and you knows it well as I do; but dere
ain't no holdin' you some times, and dis is one
of 'em, I know. Nothin' for old woman to do,
'cept just see dat you's fixed up right. You'
bonnet ain't straight, mum; I should go crazy
if you started out like ob dat."</p>

<p>The chore-man had already been at work with
shovel and broom, so that there was a path cleared
through the snow to the road; the snow was already
quite deep, and Hildegarde and her mother
were glad of their high snow-boots, as they picked
their way along. Hildegarde stopped every other
moment to take a handful of snow from some
hanging branch, sometimes to eat it, oftener to
toss it in the air for pure joy. It was beautiful
snow, soft and dry, the crystals showing with
exquisite distinctness.</p>

<p>"I feel about ten years old, darling!" the girl
announced, as she frisked hither and thither.</p>

<p>"So I perceive!" said Mrs. Grahame, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was walking soberly along, even deigning to
protect her bonnet with a prosaic umbrella.</p>

<p>"I feel rather doubtful about taking you,
Hildegarde. Suppose you should turn round
and smile at the little boy behind you, as you
did the first time I took you to church!"</p>

<p>But by the time they reached the old stone
church, Hildegarde was grave enough. This
was the best of all, she said to herself, as she
took her place in the choir, and heard Bell's firm
touch on the keys of the organ behind her.</p>

<p>The Pastoral Symphony! Hildegarde gave
a long sigh of pure happiness, and leaned back
in her seat. She might have known Bell would
play it! She knew that her friend was to take
the organist's place during the Christmas vacation;
but she did not know that somehow, in all
the hurry and happy bustle of yesterday, two
young musicians had contrived, by hook or by
crook, to get an hour's practice together in the
church, as a Christmas surprise for her very own
self, and when, above the deep, throbbing tones
of the organ, rose the exquisite voice of the violin,
Hildegarde felt her cup very full indeed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
hardly tried to check the thankful tears that
sprang to her eyes. The church was full of the
warm fragrance of balsam fir; the long garlands
of green clothed the old gray walls with a lovely
grace; she saw her mother's face in the pew near
by; the music soared heavenward and her soul
mounted with it. "Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good-will to men!" When
it came her turn to sing, she felt heaven near,
indeed, and the peace of blessedness descending
on her.</p>

<p>By noon it had stopped snowing; by three
o'clock the sky was clear and the world lay
white and glittering, a new thing under a sky
of crystal.</p>

<p>"Just like the biggest plummy cake that ever
was baked!" cried Willy Merryweather as he
capered about before his toboggan. The clan
was gathering for the first tobogganing of the
season. Here was Mr. Merryweather, tall and
stalwart, in a fur cap big enough for the Czar of
all the Russias; Here were all the children, big
and little, in "muffs and furs and fluffs," all rosy
and happy and beaming; here was Hildegarde,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in moccasins, and the prettiest scarlet blanket-suit;
finally, here was Jack Ferrers, striding
across the fields at a tremendous rate when he
saw that the others were waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack! couldn't Hugh come?" cried
Hildegarde, as her cousin came up. "He
looked pretty pale this morning, I thought,
dear little fellow! Is he feeling badly to-day?"</p>

<p>Hugh had not been like himself since the fall
on the ice. He had a good deal of headache,
and seemed heavy and drowsy, not at all his
own bright self. Hildegarde spoke anxiously,
and Jack answered her look as well as her
question.</p>

<p>"Not much the matter, I hope, but Uncle
Tom thought he'd better keep quiet this afternoon,
so as to be all fit for the tree this evening.
His head does ache, Hilda, but he says it isn't
bad, and he sent you all kinds of messages, and
said you were to have twice as good a time, for
his sake, as you would have had if he had been
on hand. Poor little chap! I promised him
I would give you a famous time; so come on,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Hilda, and don't let me see those grave looks
any more."</p>

<p>"You are darkening the sky, Hilda," cried
Gerald, "and we can't have our Christmas sunshine
spoiled! Look at the Pater! Isn't he immense?
Like a Russian Boyar, or a Wallachian
Hospodar, or something of that kind."</p>

<p>"We might all find some good, snowy title!"
said Bell. "You shall be a Starosta, Jerry, and
Phil a Voevoda, and Mr. Ferrers a Magyar."</p>

<p>"Oh, there are plenty more titles!" said
Jack. "We must have a Sotnik, and a Hetman,
and a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is coming tobogganing?" cried Mr.
Merryweather. "Is this a <i>conversazione</i>, or an
expedition?"</p>

<p>They all started off, talking and laughing, for
the nearest hill. They chose the well-known
slope that swept round the foot of Braeside,
beyond the stone wall that separated it from
Roseholme. Climbing the slope, Hildegarde remembered
the first time she had climbed it, and
how she climbed a tree, too, and was caught by
Colonel Ferrers in the act, and taken for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
marauding boy. How long ago it all seemed;
and how strange to think of their ever having
been strangers to their dear Colonel, or to any
of the good friends who had grown so near and
so dear.</p>

<p>At the top, they paused to draw breath, for
the ascent was steep; then Mr. Merryweather,
as commander-in-chief, marshalled his forces,
and arranged them in line of march.</p>

<p>"Let me see! Hilda, will you come with me?
and Gertrude? So! Now, Phil, you shall take
Bell and Kitty; and you and Mr. Ferrers, Gerald,
take the little one. There! How will that do?"</p>

<p>All declared themselves satisfied, and proceeded
to take their places on the toboggans.
The girls tucked up their skirts carefully, the
boys pressed their caps down firmly over their
ears.</p>

<p>"All ready?" asked the Chief. "Now then!
one, two, three&mdash;off!"</p>

<p>Down swept the toboggans; down, down,
down! Hildegarde was clutching Mr. Merryweather's
leather belt, and she felt as if it were
the only thing that kept her from flying off entirely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
The swift motion took her breath away;
the light snow, puffing in her face, rising up in
clouds on every side, half blinded her. On and
on, gliding now over the long meadow at the
foot of the hill, still with the flight of an arrow;
till at last, with a skilful turn, they were brought
up alongside the stone wall that bounded the
field, and landed in a good soft drift.</p>

<p>Up they all jumped, rosy and snow-powdered,
shouting with glee.</p>

<p>"Oh! wasn't it glorious!" cried Hildegarde.
"We kept the lead, didn't we, Mr. Merryweather?
And I kept the top of my head on,
which is more than could have been expected.
I really never felt anything so delightful in my
life. Where are Jack and Gerald?"</p>

<p>"There they come! They went round the other
way, down the steep side."</p>

<p>"The steep side! Oh, me! Is there a steeper
side? Why, they must have turned somersaults
all the way down. Oh! oh, my poor dears!"</p>

<p>The boys came round the curve in fine style,
shooting straight as a dart, both leaning back,
and evidently enjoying themselves to the full.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Suddenly, as if propelled by some invisible
engine, they shot into the air, the toboggan
followed, and for a moment there was an extraordinary
vision of legs and arms, caps and
splinters, all whirling together. Then they
plunged into an enormous drift, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The girls cried out in terror, but Mr. Merryweather
and Phil shouted with laughter, and
ran to the spot.</p>

<p>"Gone to ground!" they cried. "Dig 'em
out, Phil!" cried the Chief. "Here's a foot;
give a good pull, now!"</p>

<p>Phil gave a vigorous pull, and was rewarded
by a kick which sent him sprawling on his back
in the snow. Then, laughing and spluttering,
the boys emerged from the drift, rubbing the
snow from their eyes, and shaking it from their
clothing.</p>

<p>"I say!" cried Jack. "What do you keep
in this field, sir? Was it a torpedo, or an electric
eel?"</p>

<p>"It's your uncle's field, young man!" replied
Mr. Merryweather. "I suspect it was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
more than a rock, however. I thought the hill
was all smooth grass."</p>

<p>"You might try it, sir!" said Gerald. "If
there is a sound bone in my body, write me
down Hollander. How are you, Ferrers? Anything
broken?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Lost a button, and&mdash;where is
my other mitten? Oh! thank you, Hilda! Did
we make a pretty picture, flying through the
air?"</p>

<p>"Lovely!" said Hilda. "If I had only had
my camera! But I was really frightened. I
am hardly sure now that you are not killed,
you did go so very hard!"</p>

<p>"The toboggan <i>is</i> killed!" said Gerald, ruefully.
"Kindling-wood, poor old thing! Just
look at it!" He dragged to light some forlorn
remnants, which certainly did not look as if
they could be of service again save in some
humble capacity.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" said his father. "Fortune of
war, my boy! But there is plenty of room for
you and Ferrers on the two others. We must
see about this stone, and get it out of the way."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Search revealed a big, jagged stone, so fitted
into the slope of the hill that the snow had lain
smoothly over it; but it had caught the toboggan
in mid-flight. It was soon torn from its
bed, rolled down the hill, and deposited on
the other side of the wall. Then they all
climbed the hill again, trying as they went
to sing the Tobogganing Song; failing for
lack of breath, panting, singing again, and
all the while struggling upward, laughing
and chattering and pelting each other with
the soft snow.</p>

<p>
"When the field lies clear in the moon, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the wood hangs dark on the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the long white way shows never a sleigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the sound of the bells is still,</span><br />
<br />
"Then hurry, hurry, hurry!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And bring the toboggans along!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A last 'Never fear!' to Mother-my-dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then off with a shout and a song.</span><br />
<br />
"A-tilt on the billowy slope, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like a boat that bends to the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With the heart a-tilt in your breast, boy,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And your chin well down on your knee,</span><br />
<br />
"Then over, over, over,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As the boat skims over the main,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A plunge and a swoop, a gasp and a whoop,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And away o'er the glittering plain!</span><br />
<br />
"The boat, and the bird, and the breeze, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which the poet is apt to sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are old and slow and clumsy, I know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By us that have never a wing.</span><br />
<br />
"Still onward, onward, onward,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till the brook joins the meadow below,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And then with a shout, see us tumbling out,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To plunge in the feathery snow.</span><br />
<br />
"Back now by the side of the hedge, boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where the roses in summer grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the snow lies deep o'er their winter sleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Up, up the big hill we go.</span><br />
<br />
"And stumbling, tumbling, stumbling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hurrah! 'tis the top we gain!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Draw breath for a minute before you begin it&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Now over, and over again!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"How are you, noble Hetman?" said Hildegarde,
finding herself near Gerald, as they gained
the top of the hill. "Aren't you all full of snow,
my poors, and very cold and wet?"</p>

<p>"'Oh, days of me boyhood, I'm dreamin' of ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
now!'" quoted Gerald. "I never thought that
my mother's words would come true in my
person:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Woffsky-poffsky, Woffsky-poffsky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Once he was a Cossack hetman;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But he fell into the Dnieper,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And became a Cossack wetman.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"And to speak sooth, sweet chuck, there may
be a matter of half a bushel of snow&mdash;if you
measure it by bushels,&mdash;it's a matter of fancy&mdash;down
my manly back at this moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerald! But do go home, my dear, and
change your things! You will get your death
of cold, if you go about in this state."</p>

<p>"I'll move into the adjoining territory at
once!" said Gerald. "But calm yourself, angelic
being! Consider that in this manner I
avoid all danger of sunstroke! Every man his
own refrigerator; patent applied for; no Irish
need apply."</p>

<p>"What is the use of talking to people like
this!" cried Hildegarde. "Jack, are you as wet
as that? Because if you are,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As wet as what?" said Jack. "I am not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
anyhow, if you are going to look at me in that
way. Just wet enough to cool me off delightfully;
very sultry to-day, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Merryweather," cried Hildegarde. "Will
you use your authority, please, and try to get
some sense out of these boys? They are both
wet through to the skin, and they will not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wet, are they?" said the Chief, cheerily.
"Best thing in the world for 'em, my dear!
Quicken the circulation, and keep the pores open.
Now then, boys and girls, we must pack closer
this time. Sit close, Kitty! Hilda, hold tight,
my dear! All ready? Now, one, two, three,
and off we go!"</p>

<p>And off they went.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>BELLEROPHON.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">All</span> ready, boys?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"All ready!" responded the boys, namely,
Raymond Ferrers, aged sixty, Jack Ferrers, aged
twenty, and Hugh Allen, aged nine. Barring
more or less difference in height, and a trifle of
gray hair in one case, they all appeared of much
the same age; nor had the Colonel, evidently,
a day the advantage of them. On the contrary,
he was the youngest of the four, as he walked
round and round the Christmas Tree, poking
among the branches, readjusting a string of pop-corn
here, or a glittering ornament there. It
was their own tree, every twig, every needle of
it their own. Not Hildegarde herself, nor her
mother, nor any Merryweather, had had a word
to say, or knew a single detail about it. They
were invited,&mdash;they were coming; that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
their part; all the rest had belonged to the four
boys. Had they not gone in town together, and
gone to Schwartz's, and bought out the greater
part of the shop? And had they not spent the
greater part of the day (save dinner-time, and
church-time, and the hour that Jack had taken
for tobogganing) in decorating their plaything,
and tying on the presents? Surely, such a tree
had never been seen! It glittered from top to
toe with icicles; it shone with globes of gold
and silver; it was powdered with diamond snow,
and hung with golden nuts; silver cobwebs
draped it, hanging in long festoons from every
bough, while round and round, in graceful festoons,
went the long garlands of snowy pop-corn.
Now nothing was left to do, save to light the
candles; and still the Colonel walked and looked,
puffing with pleasure, and still Brother Raymond
followed at his heels, and Jack followed Raymond,
and Hugh kept close behind Jack. And
Elizabeth Beadle, surveying this scene from the
depth of the hall, was so moved by it that she
retired to the kitchen and wept for a quarter of
an hour, for pure joy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure you have the pail of water handy,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, quite sure! Stepped into it just
now."</p>

<p>"Then you had it footy, not handy!" murmured
Hugh. His guardian turned, and looked
anxiously at the boy.</p>

<p>"Hum, ha!" he said. "Talk a little nonsense,
eh, Young Sir? That's right! Feel
quite well this evening, hey?"</p>

<p>Hugh certainly did not look well. His rosy
color was gone, and there were dark circles
under his blue eyes; but he answered so brightly,
and was so full of joy and delightful anticipation,
that Colonel Ferrers smiled even as he
sighed, and turned to his brother.</p>

<p>"Pretty sight, Raymond?" he said, for perhaps
the twentieth time. "Pretty custom, eh?
Give you my word, sir, I haven't enjoyed anything
so much for years."</p>

<p>"If you go on at this rate, Tom," rejoined his
brother, "you will be in short jackets again
in a year or two. After all, what is there in
the world so good as youth, my dear fellow?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Let us hold it fast, say I, as long as we
can!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" growled the Colonel. "But you
wouldn't have said that before you came here,
Raymond Ferrers; and I shouldn't have said it
before Hildegarde Grahame came here,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And her mother!" put in Raymond.</p>

<p>"And her mother, of course!" cried the Colonel,
testily. "She never thought of coming here
without her mother, did she? Don't be a quibbler,
my good fellow! If there is one thing I
find it difficult to have Christian patience with,
it is a quibbler. I tell you, sir, that before those
people came here my life was a stagnant fish-pond,
sir; with no fish in it, either, and&mdash;and
it shows what a young woman can do, sir, when
she is willing just to <i>be</i> a young woman, and to
minister cheerfulness and joy and&mdash;and affection
to the people around her. Three years ago
I had not a friend in the world,&mdash;or thought I
had not, which amounts to the same thing,&mdash;except
a round-shouldered fiddle-maker in another
State, whom I never expected to see again.
I was morose, sir! I was unfit for human companionship!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
And now&mdash;" the Colonel stopped
to wipe his eye-glasses, and blew his nose portentously&mdash;"now
I have a son in my own house,&mdash;two
sons just now, for if you pretend that
Jack is more your son than mine, I scoff at
you, sir, and I deride you!&mdash;and a daughter
close by, who will come to me if my little
finger aches. And to that daughter, sir,&mdash;under
Providence," and the Colonel bowed his
head and dropped his voice,&mdash;"to Hildegarde
Grahame, I owe all this, and more. So I
say,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried Hugh, who had been
watching from the window. "Here they all
come, Guardian! My Beloved and her mother,
and after them all the others. Oh! but Captain
Roger is not with them!"</p>

<p>The four hosts hurried out into the hall to
meet their guests, and many and warm were
the greetings. Hildegarde in white, Bell in
pink, and Gertrude in blue, looked like a posy
of fresh flowers, and Kitty like the little rosebud
she was. Mrs. Merryweather and Mrs.
Grahame were already taking off their wraps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and Miles Merryweather and Phil brought up
the rear, with Willy.</p>

<p>"Where's the Professor?" cried the hospitable
Colonel, rubbing his hands. "Where is
Professor Roger? I was definitely promised
that he would be here."</p>

<p>Where was Roger? Hildegarde's heart echoed
the question; and though she greeted the Colonel
with her own bright smile, it was rather an
effort to be as gay as usual; for the disappointment
had been severe. Roger had telegraphed
that he would be with them that afternoon without
fail; and now all the trains had come and
gone, and no Roger had come. All the Merryweathers
were crying out, and saying that some
tiresome man of science must have captured him,
and carried him off. Hildegarde was only a
little more silent than usual; she slipped quietly
into the drawing-room, and took her seat by Mr.
Raymond Ferrers, whose smile always seemed
like a kind of sublimated music,&mdash;music that
soothed while it cheered. But when she saw
her little Hugh, with his pale face, and the suffering
look in his dear blue eyes, she reproached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
herself for a selfish, unloving girl, and went and
sat with her arm round the child, looking affectionately
and anxiously at him, and listening to
his story of the joy of the blessed day.</p>

<p>"And Gerald?" now cried the Colonel. "Am
I to be robbed of half my guests, I ask you?
Mrs. Merryweather, my dear madam, this is
positively unfriendly, I must inform you. A
Christmas Tree without Gerald Merryweather,&mdash;the
idea is incongruous! I can say nothing
more."</p>

<p>"Oh, Colonel Ferrers, that is my fault!"
cried Hildegarde. "Gerald will be here in a
moment; he ought to be here now, indeed. I
very carelessly forgot something,&mdash;a little parcel
that I wanted to bring,&mdash;and Gerald was
so kind as to go back for it."</p>

<p>"Quite right, my child!" said the Colonel.
"Of course you sent him! Preposterous if you
had done anything else." He bustled off, and
Hildegarde turned to look out of the window;
for truth to tell, the parcel that she had left
behind contained a little gift for the Colonel
himself (it was a copy of "Underwoods." Hildegarde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
would have given copies of "Underwoods"
to all her friends, if she could have
afforded it), and she wanted to catch the first
glimpse of Gerald. How long he was in coming!
They were lighting the candles, Hugh
whispered her; Jack and Mr. Raymond Ferrers
and Mr. Merryweather were to light them as
soon as the party was assembled. Gerald was
wanted to take the second tenor in the carol.
Why had she been so careless? Ah! there he
was at last!</p>

<p>Hildegarde ran out to the porch, to receive
the precious parcel.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "how long you have been,
child! I thought you would never come!"</p>

<p>"So did I," said a voice that certainly did
not belong to Gerald, "but that is no reason
why you should be out here with nothing on
your head, and the thermometer at zero."</p>

<p>Hildegarde felt her two hands grasped, and
herself drawn firmly back into the house.</p>

<p>"They do not take proper care of you!" said
Roger. "And are you glad to see me, Hilda?"</p>

<p>Everything seemed misty to Hildegarde after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that. She heard the welcomes and rejoicings;
heard Gerald's voice of panting apology,&mdash;"Couldn't
keep up with the Codger, you know!
Couldn't, 'pon my word, he was in such a
hurry!"&mdash;and received the Colonel's book in
time to tie it on the tree. She took her part
in the carol, too, and wondered that her voice
should be so strong, and not tremble, as the rest
of her seemed to be trembling. Yes, and she
saw the glorious Tree, in all its splendour, and
helped untie the presents, and sat with her lap
full of pretty things, sharing the wild delight
of Will and Kitty, and the quieter raptures of
Hugh.</p>

<p>Yes, the lion was truly splendid; she had
never heard such a roar, or seen such a mane.
She should really be afraid to come to Pumpkin
House, if she would be in danger of meeting
him on the stairs. And Hugh's fleet was a
joy, and,&mdash;yes, certainly they would go sailing
together; and they'd go to the Dee, and the
Jellybolee, over the land and over the sea&mdash;</p>

<p>And all the time, the girl felt that she was in
a dream, in which the only real thing was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
tall, broad-shouldered figure that moved so lightly
and cheerfully among the rest; was the deep,
sweet voice that was talking, explaining, parrying,
the attack of the Colonel and all his own
family?</p>

<p>"Well, but it is true, my dear Miranda. I
could not have helped it; really I could not.
No, I dined with no other friends. I dined on
a cold sausage, at a railway restaurant. I have
travelled day and night to get here, and I do
not mean to be abused for my efforts. There
was a railway accident,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An accident! Oh, Roger! are you hurt?
Where are you hurt? How did it happen?
Tell us all about it? Whose fault was it? Was
any one killed?"</p>

<p>Thus the Merryweathers in chorus, with Colonel
Ferrers thundering a bass. Roger Merryweather
looked from one to the other; his eyes
twinkled, but he was silent.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" cried his brother Miles, in a
fine baritone solo.</p>

<p>"Well, sir!" retorted Roger. "I thought
you were all doing it so beautifully, it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pity to interrupt. No,&mdash;no one was hurt. A
freight train broke down, and blocked all the
trains on the road. The delay was apparently
endless; there seemed no particular reason why
we should ever go on. Finally, I ran ahead,
and found the engineer of the night express,
the first train in the block, fighting mad, and
vowing that he would plough his way through
the freight train, if they didn't get it out of
the road in five minutes. A lot of us took
hold in good earnest, and in ten minutes the
track was free. Then the express driver found
that his fireman was hurt,&mdash;I forgot him!
He was really the only one,&mdash;and he was
madder than ever, and said he could not go
on without a fireman. So I said I was his
fireman, and his long-lost uncle besides; and I
jumped on, and off we went. It was an exhilarating
ride. We were an hour late, and we
made up half of it; but that did not let me
make my connections. Finally, here am I; the
question is, are you glad to see me, or shall I go
back?"</p>

<p>Well, there seemed little doubt that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
were glad to see him. It seemed to Hildegarde,
still sitting in her corner, with Hugh's hand in
hers, as if the other children would fairly devour
him; and the elders were not much better.
Miles must hear all about the mines, and piled
question upon question till his brother cried for
mercy. Will and Kitty hung about his neck,
Bell and Gertrude could hardly take their eyes
off him. Only Gerald, after the first moment,
came and sat by Hildegarde, and asked if he
should not take Hugh, and if she did not want
to go and join the others.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Hildegarde. "Go yourself, Jerry,
and hear all about it. I&mdash;I shall hear it all
another time."</p>

<p>"I met him, you see!" said Gerald, guiltily.
"I heard it all as&mdash;as we came from the other
house. We came along together, and then he&mdash;he
got ahead of me somehow, and came in
first."</p>

<p>Hildegarde heard him, but only half understood
what he said. Now, however, there came
a change in the boy's voice, and he rose hastily.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I will go, Hilda, if you really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
don't mind,&mdash;if you will excuse me. I think
Phil wants me for something&mdash;"</p>

<p>He vanished, and Hildegarde turned to find
Roger at her elbow.</p>

<p>"I have a little gift for you," he was saying.
"I&mdash;I won't give it to you to-night, I think,
but bring it to-morrow, if I may. It is something
I made myself, and I am rather proud of
it. May I come to-morrow morning? Oh, it is
good to be at home again! Good to see what
one has been dreaming about for all these&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Supper! supper!" cried the Colonel, rubbing
his hands. "Come, young folks! the tree
is stripped, and now for an honest, old-fashioned
supper. None of your kickshaws and folderols!
No flummery, that leaves a man tired and hungry
when he leaves the table. Food, my dear
madam, is one of the blessings&mdash;what was it
this Boy said about food the other day, Raymond?
Hugh, you understand, Mrs. Grahame;
more and more astonishing that child grows, as
he grows older. He was disappointed the other
day,&mdash;Hildegarde could not come as he expected,
or something happened,&mdash;hum, ha! And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
was distressed; a good deal distressed. Then
he ate his supper,&mdash;ate it like a man, and I
told him so, sir, and congratulated him on keeping
his appetite. He looks up at me, and says
he, 'Food stops sorrow!' His very expression,
give you my word! Food stops sorrow! Ha,
ha! so it does, my dear madam, so it does!
This way, if you please! Hildegarde, my child,
you will bring the Boy? He is&mdash;hum, ha!&mdash;not
quite up to concert pitch to-night. Nothing
much the matter,&mdash;growing boys, eh, Mrs. Grahame?
Come on, all hands!"</p>

<p>Well, the supper was great, and the games
were glorious. Hildegarde did her very best to
appear just as usual, and, indeed, no one who
had seen her flying down the long drawing-room
in the Virginia reel (the Colonel had engaged
her for it a month before) would have thought
her anything but the gayest of the gay; but,
happy though she was, the world still seemed
misty, the rooms confused, the talk mere babble;
and she was glad, for once, when the frolic was
over, and the greetings said, and she was at
home once more, in her own quiet room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a cosy little fire burning on the
hearth, and late though it was, Hildegarde was
in no mood for going to bed. She sat down by
the window and looked out. The snow lay clear
and white in the moonlight; here and there the
dark evergreens rose like steadfast guardians;
all was peaceful and lovely. Lovely! How
brown and handsome he looked! And had he
really been glad to see her? She thought so;
yes, surely he was glad, only somebody interrupted
him every time he came near her. Of
course, selfish creature that she was! They
were his own dear people, he was theirs; he
belonged to them. They had not seen him for
months, and how preposterous of her to expect
to have any of his time the very first evening.
Besides, he said particularly that he was coming
in the morning. Would the day be fair? But
men did not mind weather, certainly not the
Merryweather men. And&mdash;and her mother
would be so glad to have a good talk with
him.</p>

<p>Were they all asleep now, the good, merry
neighbours? They made a good deal of noise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
sometimes, but they all meant so well, and were
so hearty and genuine. Gerald was the most
like Roger, after all; she had never noticed
before how much alike they were. Dear Jerry!
He had always been her favourite, though Phil
was as nice as he could be, and, of course, she
was very, very fond of Bell, and all of them.
How perfectly clear and still it was! Silver
and pearl and diamond,&mdash;oh, what beauty!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Deep on the convent roof the snows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Are sparkling to the moon."</span><br />
</div>

<p>She wondered if her white dress was really
the one she should have worn, or whether&mdash;whether
any one would have thought the pink
one prettier. No; he always liked white; she
remembered his saying so. There was a light
in the corner room of Pumpkin House; ah,
yes! it was Roger's room. Such a funny room,
all full of minerals and dried specimens, and
with lengths of copper wire hanging all about
the walls. Jerry said that Roger had put them
there against the time he should be crossed in
love, so that he could hang himself whenever he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
felt like it. What was it he had brought for her?
A specimen, probably. No! for he had made it
himself. What was he doing now, she wondered.
Oh, it was so good, so good, to know that he
was near, and that she should see him in the
morning!</p>

<p>"But now," said Hildegarde, shaking her
shoulders, and pulling herself together, "you
are going to bed, miss! Let me have no more
of this ridiculous moon-gazing, do you hear?
Have you any sense? Take one look at the
white glory of it, and then off with you!"</p>

<p>Wrapping a shawl round her (for she was still
in her white evening dress, though it was an
hour and more since she came back from Roseholme),
she opened the window for an instant,&mdash;softly,
for fear of rousing her mother, and leaned
out, to take one deep draught of the magical
beauty of the night. As she gazed, held as with
a charm,&mdash;what was that, that seemed to move
by the corner of the hedge? What was it, white
against the snow, that was stealing along by the
garden wall, silent as a dream? Was she, indeed,
dreaming? Hildegarde's heart stood still for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
moment. A little figure came forward now
across the lawn,&mdash;it stood out clear against the
dark firs. Good heavens! It was little Hugh!
Barefoot, in his white nightgown, his head held
high, his eyes gazing straight forward, the child
came on, with swift, certain steps. One more
glance told Hildegarde the truth; he was walking
in his sleep.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="263" height="400" alt="&quot;A LITTLE FIGURE ... STOOD OUT CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK FIRS.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A LITTLE FIGURE .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. STOOD OUT CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK FIRS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>In a flash she had stolen down the stairs, only
stopping to snatch a warm cloak from the hall
as she went. The bar and chain delayed her,
for she dared not strike a match,&mdash;her mother's
light sleep was too precious,&mdash;still, it seemed
only an instant before she was on the lawn,
gazing wildly about her. The child was gone!
An instant she stood undecided; was it possible
that the whole had been a vision, a hallucination,
brought on by excitement and fatigue? No!
For here were the little footprints in the
snow.</p>

<p>Oh, the little, tender feet, stung by the bitter
cold! How was it possible that the touch of
the snow had not waked him? But here was
her clue; in another moment, surely, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
should have him in her arms. Breathless and
panting, Hildegarde ran round the corner of
the house, following those little white tracks&mdash;and
stopped. The footsteps broke off short.
Looking up, bewildered, she uttered a low cry
of terror. Hugh was climbing up the wall.
This part of the house was low, a kind of shed
or outhouse, seldom used. It was easy climbing
enough, a window-sill here, a cornice there, and
a spout that ran the whole way up to the shingled
roof. Hildegarde had climbed it herself, in
pursuit of a runaway kitten; if the child would
only stop at the shed roof she could easily follow
him. But above rose the steep-pitched
upper roof! What should she do if he went on?
What should she do? She dared not call, for
now the little figure, steadily climbing upward,
stood on the shed roof; hesitated a moment,
turned half towards her,&mdash;then turned back, and
set his foot on the short ladder that led to the
upper roof. Instantly Hildegarde's knee was on
the first low window-sill. She was reaching up,
on the point of raising herself to her feet, when
she started violently, and nearly lost her balance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
A hand was laid on her shoulder; a steady,
restraining hand.</p>

<p>"What upon earth does this mean?" asked
Roger Merryweather.</p>

<p>His voice was stern, or Hildegarde fancied it
so; she answered like a child:</p>

<p>"I am going after Hugh!"</p>

<p>"Going after&mdash;" began Roger, stupefied.
Then following her upward gesture, he broke
off short.</p>

<p>"Go into the house, my child!" he said,
quickly, in his own kind tone. "Go at once;
you must not stay out another moment in this
thin dress. I will bring him to you in the house.
It will be only a minute now, and he will be
quite safe."</p>

<p>With that he was up like a cat, clinging here,
springing there, never pausing, never seeming to
take his eyes from the little white figure, which
had now reached the summit of the steep-pitched
roof. Hildegarde gave one glance at the child,
and saw him standing with outstretched arms
on the ridge-pole itself. His voice came down,
clear and calm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am ready, dear Bellerophon! We will fly
together now, down, down,&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl covered her face, and prayed. It
was a breath of time, it was eternity, before
Roger's voice came down to her, strong and
cheerful.</p>

<p>"We will go down together, Hughie. I was
up here, too, and I will take you down, because
you will be more comfortable that way. Put
your arms round my neck, so! Hold on tight&mdash;that's
right! Now, down we go!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde stood still in the snow, her hands
still clutching the window-sill. She seemed incapable
of speech or motion; could only listen
to the quiet, steady voice, as it soothed the now
awake and frightened child.</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose you went up to get a ball,
or something that had been thrown up there.
Eh? No? Something about Bellerophon?
Where is he? Well, he may be in the house,
laddie. We'll go in and see, anyhow. Your
Beloved is there, you know, and she will be&mdash;<i>Hildegarde</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Roger!" said Hildegarde, faintly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told you to go into the house!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Roger; I am going!" And then Hildegarde
sank down in a little white heap at
Roger's feet, and knew nothing more.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>AT LAST.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hildegarde</span> was sitting by Hugh's bedside.
He had been laid in her bed that night; how
long ago was it? She hardly knew,&mdash;and was
still too ill to be moved. A concussion of the
brain, the doctor said, the result of his fall on
the ice. There was danger of brain fever, but
it might be averted. Absolute quiet for a few
days, and the trouble might pass off without
any serious developments. Meantime, a shaded
room, plenty of ice, no noise, and as little change
of faces around him as might be,&mdash;they would
hope for the best.</p>

<p>Hildegarde had hardly left his side, save
when Auntie came in to watch through the
night, or her mother took her place for the short
time that her strength allowed. Mrs. Grahame
was far from strong, and was not allowed to
take charge of the nursing, as she would so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
gladly have done. Colonel Ferrers hung about
the house all day, like a man distracted; and
it took all Mrs. Grahame's tact, and all his
brother's and Jack's watchful devotion, to keep
him out of the sick child's room. He seemed to
have aged ten years in these few short days.
His ruddy colour was gone; his eyes had lost
their fiery spark; his military stride had given
place to an anxious shuffle.</p>

<p>"We shall have you ill, sir!" Elizabeth
Beadle remonstrated, with many tears.</p>

<p>"You ain't like Mr. Raymond, sir; you cannot
go without your food. It's hard enough as
I can't go to my baby, my own dear niece's
child, to nurse him myself, as go I would if I
was let, though Miss Hilda may be a better
nurse, as you say; but blood is thicker than
water, Colonel Ferrers, and if I have to have
you sick, too, it will be more than I can bear,
sir; yes, it will!" Thus Mrs. Beadle, with her
apron at her eyes. The Colonel, roused for a
moment from his anxious musing, turned upon
her with something like his natural fury.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> go to the child, Elizabeth Beadle?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
You, who cannot keep from crying for ten
minutes together? If you would stop poisoning
my food with salt water, ma'am, you might
have less complaint to make of my not eating.
You have no more sense, ma'am,&mdash;no more
sense than&mdash;than some other people have.
Don't look at me in that manner, I desire you!
God bless you, my dear old soul; go along, will
you, or I shall be crying, too."</p>

<p>Rumours of these things, and others like them,
came to Hildegarde, as she sat hour after hour
by the sick child's side, shifting his pillow now
and then when it grew hot, laying the cool wet
cloths on his forehead, giving him food, drink,
medicine, at the appointed times. The whole
world seemed narrowed down to this one room;
everything outside was unreal, all save the scene
in white and black that she saw whenever she
closed her eyes,&mdash;the moonlight on the snow,
the black firs, the child in his white dress, fronting
death with his sleeping smile, and by her
side the friend who was to save him. How long
ago was it? Had she been sitting here three
days, or three weeks?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Hugh lay still, with his eyes shut. He
seemed unconscious for the most part. Only
now and then came a motion of the head, a low
moan that was hardly more than a whisper;
then the blue-veined lids would lift heavily for
an instant, and the sweet eyes look out, but
with no light in them; and after a moment the
lids would fall again wearily, and the heavy
sleep close round him again like a curtain.
How long would it last?</p>

<p>More snow had fallen. She heard the sound
of bells, and the soft swish of sleigh-runners
passing swiftly by. The voices of her neighbours
came to her, now and then, but never
calling loud and joyous, as they were wont to
do. Every sound was subdued; every one moved
softly and spoke low, with the sick child constantly
in their thoughts.</p>

<p>Guests came to Pumpkin House; long-invited
guests, who could not well be put off. Hildegarde
knew this, and knew that her friends
loved her and the child no less because they
were now forced to play the hosts, and to make
pleasure for the holiday visitors. Was this the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
evening of the Flower Party? Her dress was
hanging ready in the closet. Such a pretty
dress! She was to be a wild rose, and the
graceful pink petals curved over the skirt, and
curled upward to form the bodice.</p>

<p>What a pity that some one could not wear it!
She might send it over, in case some one of the
guests had no costume ready. Bell was to be
an apple-blossom; Gertrude, a lily. The twins
would be splendid as Larkspur and Scarlet Runner.
And would Roger&mdash;would he go in fancy
dress? She could not imagine him doing anything
of the kind, somehow. She thought of
him in boating dress, or in his camp jersey
and knickerbockers&mdash;or, as she saw him last,
in evening dress, climbing over the snowy roofs&mdash;she
shuddered, and laid her hand on Hugh's
arm, to make sure that he was there. The
child was safe, at any rate. He was not going
to die. Hildegarde kept this thought resolutely
away from her, and was only conscious of it as
a dim horror, lurking in a corner of her brain.
He would be better soon, perhaps in a day or
two. It might even be that she would see Roger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
before he went back to the West,&mdash;for he would
be going soon, no doubt. He would be sorry,
she thought, to go without seeing her. But
she had his gift; he had sent it to her the day
after Christmas. She put her hand to her
throat, to make sure it was there&mdash;the brooch
that he had made himself for her, digging
the gold, refining, hammering, fashioning it,
all with his own hands. She would never
wear any other brooch! Dear old Jack, too.
He was missing her from his vacation, she
knew. Her mother said that he and Bell
were practising together every day, and that
all the Merryweathers were delighted with
him. He and the twins were becoming fast
friends. But they all missed her. They all
said that there was no luck about any of the
houses, with Hildegarde awa'. The tears came
to the girl's eyes. Everybody was so good to
her, so kind, so loving!</p>

<p>Hugh moved uneasily, and she bent over
him; his lips moved. "Play!" said the child.</p>

<p>"Dear!" said Hildegarde, softly. "My laddie!
Do you want something?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh did not open his eyes, but a smile, or
the shadow of a smile, hovered about his lips for
an instant.</p>

<p>"Play&mdash;Jack&mdash;play!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear! He shall come. We will send
for him; rest now, my boy, quietly!"</p>

<p>But now, seeing her mother at the door, Hildegarde
stole softly to her, and told of the whispered
words. "Will you ask the doctor? He
might&mdash;it might&mdash;do him good, if he is
thinking about it? You will see what is best,
dear!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame nodded, and went away. An
hour passed, as all the others passed. Then
Hildegarde heard steps on the veranda; the
door opened and closed quietly; the next
moment the voice of the violin came stealing
through the house. Ah! what was it? Were
angels singing the child to sleep? Schubert's
Cradle Song; there is no sweeter melody on
earth, and many times had Jack played little
Hugh to sleep with it, in the days before he
went abroad. Hildegarde watched the child
intently. At the first note of the music he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
stirred, and opened and closed his hands, which
lay listless on the counterpane. Then, as the
song flowed on, so low, so tender, it seemed the
voice of a spirit, or of some wandering wind,
caught and trained to melody; the brows which
had been knitted, as if in an effort to think,
relaxed, a smile came to the sweet lips and settled
there happily.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Schlafe, schlafe, s&uuml;sser, holder Knabe!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Leise wiegt dich deiner Mutter Hand."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Sing!" whispered Hugh; and Hildegarde
sang, her heart beating high with joy and hope;
for this was the first time she had been sure of
his knowing her. She bent over him, hoping
for a glance of recognition; but he did not open
his eyes. His face seemed to clear and lighten
every moment; it was as if a cloud were passing,
and the day shining out fair and lovely;
but he turned his head drowsily, and whispered,
"Sleepy!"</p>

<p>Now Jack was playing the Chopin <i>berceuse</i>,
and all the world seemed lulling to sleep; the
sound floated in waves through the darkened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
room, whispering in corners, rippling round the
drowsy child, bearing him on, away, through
the gates of pearl, till now he was asleep, in
no heavy lethargy this time, but lying easily,
breathing deeply, his whole little form at rest,
at peace. And seeing this, the weary girl beside
him laid her head on the child's pillow, and
borne on those waves of dreamy sound, she, too,
passed through the white gates, and slept.</p>

<p>They slept so all through that night. Mrs.
Grahame and Auntie, coming to relieve Hildegarde,
could not bear to wake her. The doctor put
his head in at the door, gazed for a moment, and
then nodded, and tiptoed off down-stairs and
home to bed, wiping his eyes as he went. The
Colonel and Jack, making their last call for the
night, heard the joyful report, and departed
treading on air. And still they slept. The
black woman nodded in her chair in the corner;
she had put Mrs. Grahame to bed, and returned
to watch the night with her charge, all the more
precious now that her "own chile" was sleeping
beside him. Now and then a coal fell, and tinkled
in the fireplace; the night-light burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
steadily, but the fire flared, and drooped, and
leaped up again, filling the quiet room with
flitting lights and shadows. Were they spirits,
bending over those two fair heads on the pillow,
side by side? The angels might be glad to come
a good way to see such a sight as that, Auntie
said to herself. And she nodded, and dreamed
of the Golden City, and woke again to see always
the same quiet room, to hear always the same
sweet breathing of peace and rest and returning
health.</p>

<p>It was morning when Hildegarde awoke; dim,
early morning, with the stars still shining, but
with a faint, pearly radiance growing momently
stronger in the east. She wondered at first what
was the matter, and why she was sitting up in
bed, rather stiff, with soft things wrapped round
her. Before she moved her eyes fell on the little
face beside her, and she remembered all, and
gave thanks to God for his mercy before she
stirred. Raising herself softly, she saw Auntie
sitting in her great chair, bolt upright, but
sound asleep.</p>

<p>"Poor dear!" thought the girl. "She need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
not have come at all. We did not need anything,
Hugh and I. We have had a good, good
rest."</p>

<p>Beyond changing her position, and stretching
her limbs, cramped by staying so long in one
posture, she did not move, but sat with folded
hands, full of such happy thoughts that the
morning seemed to come on wings of gold.</p>

<p>The sun was up before Auntie woke, and
her frightened exclamation, "Fo' gracious goodness!
ef I ain't be'n 'sleep myself!" though
hardly spoken above a whisper, echoed sharply
through the silent room.</p>

<p>Hugh opened his eyes, and his glance fell directly
on Hildegarde. He smiled, and stretched
out his arms.</p>

<p>"Beloved," he said, "I am very glad to see
you; but what are you doing in my room?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde made no answer. She bent over
and took the child in her arms; raised him a
little, with his head resting on her shoulder, so
that he could see beyond her. His eyes travelled
round the room, growing rounder and
larger every moment, as in the broadening light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
one object after another shone out, familiar, and
yet strange.</p>

<p>"Beloved," he said, "I beg your pardon!
But what am <i>I</i> doing in <i>your</i> room? Will
you make me understand, please?"</p>

<p>"You have been asleep, darling!" said Hildegarde.
"You were not very well, and&mdash;and
you happened to be here at the time, and so&mdash;we
put you to bed here, you see."</p>

<p>"I don't see very well!" said Hugh, in quite
his own manner. "But probably I shall in a
little while. How long have I been asleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a long time. But aren't you
hungry now, little boy? See, here is Auntie,
and she is going to bring you up some breakfast,
the very best breakfast you can think of. What
do you say to chicken broth?"</p>

<p>Hugh nodded and smiled at Auntie, who stood
devouring him with her eyes.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" he said. "I think I shall be
hungry,&mdash;when my think comes back a little
more. My think&mdash;my mind&mdash;has been asleep,
I am pretty sure!" he added, looking up at Hildegarde
with his quiet, penetrating gaze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I had only just gone to sleep with my
eyes, Beloved, I should remember about it; and
I don't&mdash;remember&mdash;much of anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about it now, Hughie!
When you feel stronger we will talk it all over.
See! I want to bathe your face and smooth
your hair before breakfast comes. Now you
shall be my baby, and I will curl your golden
locks for you. Shall I put something good in
the water? There! Isn't that nice and fresh?
And now you shall put on my dressing-jacket;
my beautiful new dressing-jacket, that Bell made
for me. Here it is, all fluttering with pink ribbons.
Wasn't it dear of Bell to make it?"</p>

<p>"Bell!" said Hugh, meditatively; he seemed
to be searching for something in his mind.</p>

<p>"Bell&mdash;Bellerophon!"</p>

<p>"Never mind about Bellerophon now, dear,"
said Hildegarde, trying to hide her anxiety, and
to speak lightly. "We will have Bellerophon
by and by; we don't want him here."</p>

<p>But Hugh was not to be turned aside; his
brain was now fully awake, and at work, but
his look was so calm and clear, his voice so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
natural and peaceful, that Hildegarde felt relieved
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"I have to consider a little, Beloved," he
said, cheerfully, "just to straighten out my
think, which appears to be somewhat mixed.
What&mdash;was&mdash;I&mdash;doing&mdash;on a roof?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde held her peace. The child must
take his own way, she felt; she did not dare to
cross him.</p>

<p>"I went up&mdash;on a roof!" Hugh went on.
"I <i>think</i> it was a roof, Beloved?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde nodded.</p>

<p>"And there&mdash;I was Pegasus, you remember;
I have been Pegasus a great deal lately, but
I shall not be him for a good while now, because
I have had enough,&mdash;I was Pegasus, and
I wanted Bellerophon. The Christmas Tree
frightened him away, so I came&mdash;somewhere&mdash;perhaps
here? and I thought it was a mountain.
I thought it was Helicon, and if I climbed
up to the top, Bellerophon would come to me,
and we would fly down and kill the Chim&aelig;ra,
don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I see, dear, of course! And then&mdash;?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I called out to Bellerophon that I was
ready, and we would fly. But&mdash;but just as we
were going to fly, some strong person took hold
of me, and I looked, and I was on a roof, with
Captain Roger holding me. Where is Captain
Roger, Beloved? And where was the roof?"</p>

<p>"The roof was here, dear child! You were
walking in your sleep, Hugh. You climbed up
to the upper roof, and&mdash;and Captain Roger saw
you, and went after you, and brought you down.
That is how you came to be in my room, Hugh.
Now you understand it all, darling, and you will
not worry any more about it."</p>

<p>Hugh looked relieved.</p>

<p>"Now I shall not worry any more about it!"
he repeated, with satisfaction. "It <i>was</i> puzzling
me dreadfully, Beloved, and I could not get
straight till I saw how it was, but now I see.
My head has been queer ever since I fell down on
the ice; I think Bellerophon got bumped into it,
don't you? But now he is bumped out again,
and he may go and kill the Chim&aelig;ra himself,
for I sha'n't stir a step."</p>

<p>His laughter rang out fresh and joyous; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
at the sound Mrs. Grahame came running in,
at first in great anxiety, fearing delirium; but
when she saw the two happy faces, beaming
with smiles, and heard Hugh addressing her
in his own quaint fashion, and hoping that she
had slept very well indeed, she could not keep
back the tears of joy. Seeing these tears, Hildegarde
must needs weep a little, too; but they
were such tears as did no one any harm, and
Hugh said at once, "This is a sun-shower! And
now we shall have a rainbow, and after that
some breakfast."</p>

<p>When the breakfast came, you may be sure
it was served on the very best tray the house
afforded,&mdash;the gold-lacquered one, with the
bronze dragon curling about it; and the broth
was in the blue S&egrave;vres bowl, with golden pheasants
strutting round it.</p>

<p>"Dem's de nearest to chick'ns I could find!"
said Auntie, and Hildegarde forbore to point out
to her that she, Hildegarde, had never been
allowed to so much as dust this precious piece
of china, much less to eat out of it. And the
toast was like thin strips of edible gold, so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
both Hugh and Hildegarde declared King Midas
could not have had such a bad time of it after
all, if he had a cook anything like Auntie. It
was hard to tell who most enjoyed the broth
and toast, Hugh who ate it, Auntie who made
it, or Hildegarde who held the spoon, and broke
off the crisp bits. It was a happy little feast,
and the doctor was a joyful man when he looked
in on it an hour or so later. He said that all
would go well now.</p>

<p>"Slowly! slowly! No hurry! Keep him
here a while yet, and don't let him see too
many people; no excitable folks, who will weep
over him,"&mdash;Hilda and her mother exchanged
a guilty glance,&mdash;"keep him in bed for a day
or two, till he gets his balance entirely. Good-bye!
God bless you!"</p>

<p>The good man trotted off briskly, and they
heard him greeting some one on the veranda
below.</p>

<p>"Doing finely! finely! All right now; a
little quiet, a little care,&mdash;going in? Yes!
Oh, yes! See you all right! Told them to
keep noisy folks away. Good-morning!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Grahame went out, and spoke in a low
voice with some one now in the hall. Some
one was speaking in return, very low; yet
not so low but that Hildegarde's heart began
to throb, and the colour to mount high over
cheek and brow; not so low but that Hugh,
who had the fine ear of some woodland creature,
sat up in bed, and clapped his hands.</p>

<p>"It is Captain Roger, Beloved! It is himself;
do you hear his voice? And he must come
up, please, this moment of time, to see me, and
to let me tell him what is in my heart for him."</p>

<p>Hildegarde hesitated; there was a tumult
within her that made her feel uncertain what
was best to do or say; but in this moment Mrs.
Grahame had brought Roger up-stairs, and now
he was here, on the threshold. He was in the
room; he was holding her hand, and looking at
her with his bright, kind gaze.</p>

<p>Neither of them spoke; it was Hugh who
broke the silence. Roger had sat down by him,
after that first silent greeting, and kissed his
forehead, and took both the child's hands in
his.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard you, Captain Roger; I heard the
first tone of your voice, and you sounded like
an angel."</p>

<p>"Did I, Hugh? I don't think I look like an
angel, do you? Did you ever see a picture of
one with a moustache?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but it says that they don't
always look like themselves, you know. Many
times they looked just like common men in the
Bible. And you were an angel when you came
to me on the roof the other night."</p>

<p>Roger glanced quickly at Hildegarde; the girl
nodded.</p>

<p>"He knows," she said. "I could not keep
it from him, the moment he was himself again.
He pieced it all out, with hardly any help from
me."</p>

<p>Roger looked grave, but his anxious look
rested on Hildegarde, not on Hugh.</p>

<p>"Did you take cold?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I? No, certainly not! Why should I take
cold?"</p>

<p>"In your thin evening dress!" said Roger,
reproachfully. "With slippers on your feet,&mdash;there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
you stood in the snow, and would not go
in when I told you. I have thought of nothing
but pneumonia and consumption ever since.
But&mdash;you look pretty well, I think!"</p>

<p>Hildegarde laughed in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you believed in being wet!"
she said.</p>

<p>"For myself&mdash;of course! We are all polar
bears, more or less; but it is different with
you."</p>

<p>"Very different!" said Hildegarde. "I had
snow-boots on, Captain Roger, all the time!
Your anxiety has been thrown away, you see."</p>

<p>"So!" said Roger, with a look of intense
relief. "I never thought of that! I&mdash;I didn't
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't think I had sense enough!"
cried Hildegarde. "No more I had! They
just happened to be on my feet, because I
hadn't taken them off. I had been sitting and
looking out of the window, ever since the Christmas
Tree."</p>

<p>"So had I!" said Roger. "That was how
we both happened to see. The moral is&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not say what the moral was, but sat
pulling his moustache, and looking at Hildegarde.
Hildegarde felt herself blushing again;
she tried to speak of some trivial thing, but the
words died on her lips; the silence deepened
every moment, and it seemed as if she and Roger
were drowning in it, going deeper and deeper
down, down,&mdash;</p>

<p>Hugh looked cheerfully from one to the other;
he saw that they were embarrassed for some
reason, and came to the rescue with his usual
calm philanthropy.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten what you wanted to
say? When I am going to say anything, and
then forget what I wanted to say, I say, 'I
love you!'"</p>

<p>Roger broke into a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Hugh!" he said. "There is
not much need of my saying it, but&mdash;shall I,
Hilda?"</p>

<p>Hildegarde could not speak. She looked up,
and meeting her eyes, Roger held out his hand
across the little bed,&mdash;the strong, faithful hand
that had helped her now so many times,&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
she laid hers in it, and felt its earnest clasp, and
knew that there was no more any parting between
Roger and her.</p>
